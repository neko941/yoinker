        "Many nations encourage travel. This essay will suggest that the benefit of tourism adds to country's revenue, while unwanted travellers damaging the nation's property is the drawback.",
        "The travel industry is growing in many countries and is one of the major sources of income. Every nation has destinations, that people from around the globe would want to visit during their holidays. There are many cities what have places, that consists of tourist attraction, which includes historic, natural and many other locations. Whenever people tour other countries they normally visit with their family and friends, in some cases a whole group of individuals travel along with a travel agent, and they visit not only one but many locations. For example, there was an article printed in the Times of India that, travel and tourism industry have increased by 25% in the last three years under the current government.",
        "Despite this benefit, there travelling people can be a cause for worry. Tourists generally come on vacations with families and friends to enjoy themselves, who can at times damage the property of the places that they visit, since they are in a festive mood. This causes a loss to the profits of that place, which in turn is harmful to the country. There can also be some tourists that indulge in criminal activities and not follow the laws of the nation. To illustrate, some of the hotels visited by the tourists have complained that, their furniture was damaged and things accessories such as towels, napkins were stolen.",
        "To conclude, the travel and tourism industry should be encouraged and more number of visitors must be welcomed which boosts of countries, but damages done by the visitors should be controlled. It is predicted that by end of 2025 the number of tourists will grow by 20%."
