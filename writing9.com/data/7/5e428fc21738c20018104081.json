This means they are always reachable to their family members outside of working hours. For instance, my uncle is running his own business with his siblings and often time they discuss their business related talk on the dinning table. Furthermore, As a family working together, they have  leverage in terms of each ones personality and characteristics and utilize them accordingly for their benefit. As a result, they achieve maximise results, while, supporting and understanding.",
        "On the other side, Family running business has limited scope to the latest market trends, which could cause adverse effects on the company heritage.

For example, my same uncle faced the issues with the novel product upgrade was available in the market and he was not aware of that, which leads to the customer's discomfort and effected the business growth. Consequently, we could understand the disadvantage of having own family business.",
