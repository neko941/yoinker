        "Dear Sir ,",
        "I am writing this letter to inform you about the severe trouble caused due to the current change in the local bus service timings. Earlier, the bus used to arrive by around 7 am , however, now with the revised timings the bus arrives at around 6 am. This, has caused severe problems to the staff staying in the Sanabis area.",
        "The timings  not taking into consideration the convenence of the staff. Sadly, no communication nor prior notice was given. Further, in the early mornings the winter cold is terrible and most of the staff end up with health issues frequently.  For instance , the mornings are so dark and cold that one of our staff had an injury while stepping out of her home.",
        "Personally , i feel this change in timings to be unfair on the staff and this has terribly affected our productivity. As you are aware many countries adopt a flexible timing during the winter season and hence, I request you to kindly reconsider this decision.",
