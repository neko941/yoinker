        "I am writing to express my interest in Volunteer work that was published in Australia times a week ago. The information included organising an event for charity.",
        "Let me take you through  why I am keen on this event. Well, ever since childhood I have seen my parents involved in contributing to the organisation that supports homeless children. Every month they would donate clothes or even prepare home-cooked meals for the kids. Moreover, during school days there was an NGO that provided free education to the less fortunate.\u00a0Therefore, all these experiences helped me to understand the importance of empathy.",
        "As far as my past work experience is concerned, you would be delighted to know that I have worked a year with a fundraising company that supports child abuse and animals. Furthermore, I have even been an organiser for a charity event that took place within my university. As a result, won the first prize as a young achiever.",
        "For your consideration and approval, I would like to elicit two suggestions: Firstly, I can be a good candidate for handling team and floor placements as I do hold expertise within these areas. Secondly, I think I might be able to help you with banner placements as I hold experience as a graphic designer.",
        "Therefore, Kindly let me know if my expertise interests you. In case your need any further details, Please feel free to reach out.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you!",
