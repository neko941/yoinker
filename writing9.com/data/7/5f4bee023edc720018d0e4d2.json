        "Experimental skills  really essential in this  modern  It is said by some individuals that  they should learn  these skills  at their schools, so that they can  get better job opportunities  in the future. I agree with the given statement and my viewpoints  on this issue will be elaborated in the aforementioned paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, There are  different kind of skills such as  car maintenance, cooking, gardening, painting, dancing and computer graphic designing, and there are numerous benefits of learning these at an early age because when children are young they  can  acquire  any skill  quickly. For instance,   a survey was conducted   by William Smith  in all the developed countries and  a report was submitted  in which  it was concluded that  if all  children should be made aware about car  maintenance then , there would be the poosibility in the future that less  money could be spent by people  for the repair of cars in upcoming years and it will definitely reduce the living expenses of the people.",
        "Besides this,  Children  are usually dependent on  their parents for  the management of their money. For example, In India seventy percent youth  rely on their  parents and they  manage their  bank accounts  because they have little knowledge about  banking services so. , if this  kind of knowledge should be imparted at school level, then there  would be the possibility in the future that children would manage their monthly  budget smartly  and they  can realize the true value of money.",
        "To recapitulate, I would like to write that all types of practical skills should be taught at school because  it will bring more job opportunities for the youngsters."
