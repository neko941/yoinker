        "In this competitive era, Education plays a significant role in one's life, due to the high competition level. It is believed by some people children should attend extra class or tuition after school, while others have an opposite view. I agree with the first view and in this essay, I would shed light on both the sides and justify my view.",
        "There are certain reasons to support my view. The first point of prime importance is that Sometimes children did not get the proper chance to learn some special topic like Science, History and mathematics, So to cover these type of important and difficult subjects student have to join the extra classes for their better future after school. To cite an example, The survey of the Calgary city university showed that 70% of learner got more than 90% markes with the helped of the extra lecture because they spent their leisure time with their teacher.",
        "Another point in the list is that the extra coaching classes help to improve communication skills and personal development such as courses like English speaking, HR education brings confidence level of the youngster. Because at school children have not time to learn these skill, due to their major subjects. In addition to this, In the tuition time teachers have a chance to improve the capability of week students. For example, Sometimes in school hours teachers cannot focus of children who have the problem to understand the valuable chapters, but with the help of the extra class, they can explain it to them with the different and easy methods.",
        "On the other hand, there are some people who contradict the above said. As per them classes after school increase the burden of study and killing the playing time of teenager. Moreover, They assert that it has negative effects on children health because after 8 hours of schooling all students need to relax for their mental growth.",
        "Conclusion, It can be deduced that there are both sides of the above-said question. However, If I have to choose one, then I believe that the first view is more effective and powerful than the second one. So, I according to my experience extra classes after school is helpful to improve the academic of the children's."
