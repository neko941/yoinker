        "In recent times the importance of old historic buildings and modern buildings cannot be ignored, Although many people agree to the conservation of old historic buildings  in our cities today and I consider  the statement and  believe my ideas and points would be discussed in the essay and examples would be given",
        "On the one hand people think preservation of old historic buildings are vital to our development and accept  the statement, for example a group of researchers carried out a survey in Rome about the cultural tale behind historic buildings and how they have impacted our modern day developments and education and why they cannot be completely erased. The study gave more relevance to the importance and constant relation of these historic structures to modern day life",
        "On the other hand people agree to erasing old building and replacing with modern structures.  For instance Alhaji Elrufia who spent a major part of his governance demolishing  old historic buildings and replacing with new and modern structures ended up losing the  historic value of a city and replaced with modern structures and it gave a negative impact on tourism.  Clearly  we are in recent and mordern times and development is imminent but our old values cannot be overemphasised and therfore must be safe guarded to a large extent",
        "in conclusion , we have alot of people with diverse thought and reasoning in our world today but i believe old and historic building play a vital role in our existence by displaying our history and monuments of how it all began and will be carried on from generations to generations and history can never be forgotten"
