        "Imposing strict traffic laws is regarded as effective in decreasing the rate of violators. Admittedly, this measure is of great help to the limit of serious accidents happening on the streets; that is because there have been the transport vehicles in big cities during rush hours, whereby not least participants are willing to violate laws if serve punishments are not implemented in their countries. To take an obvious example, drunken driving, running means of transportation with imprisoned in case the law- breakers cause serious accidents. The more harsh regulations are issued, the better people's awareness of safe driving will be.",
        "In reality, traffic problems associated with a lot of elements such as street conditions, lights, signs, etc. need to be taken into consideration carefully by the authorities so that citizens can avoid unexpected accidents with regarded to rough the streets. In this situation, the national budget ought to be used for improving the quality of roads or had more patrols at hot spots so as to prompt interventions. What is more, driving skill training courses have to be conducted seriously; simultaneously, it is essential that competitions of safe driving need to be organized regularly- an effective way to reduce the cases of limited ability to operate vehicles.",
        "It is a fact that road safety is always a top concern of the governments and people all over the world, especially when the quantities of traffic accidents have increased significantly in recent years. That is the rationale accounting for why one opinion of this  worrying issue is to punish offenders severely, yet my perception is that there are more approaches to make sure that vehicle users can get safety when moving on the streets",
        "From what I have highlighted  above, I can draw a conclusion that government investments in enhancing traffic infrastructure quality as well as preventive measures are very essential. More importantly, educational programs of road safety still play a vital role in shaping travelling culture, notably encouraging all members in society to improve their driving abilities."
