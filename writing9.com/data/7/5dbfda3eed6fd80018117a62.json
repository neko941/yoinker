        "Some would argue that young people should be taught about how to become an ethical individual in society by their parents. Others claim that it is a responsibility of the education institute. I, personally, believe that parent are the most important people in the children\u2019s life because they spend most of their time with them and they always try to copy their parents instinctively.",
        "On the one hand, some people say that teachers are responsible to make children to become a successful person of the society because they argue that parents pay huge amount of money to school to make their children a better person. They believe that teachers are the people who should teach their pupils about self-management skills. And those schools who teach such skills to their students then those students become successful in future and make their schools proud. For instance, a recent survey of The University of Karachi found that 70% students who get international scholarship from Pakistan went to The City School or Beconhouse Schooling System.",
        "On the other hand, others argue that parents have made more impact on children\u2019s life because children spend most of their time with parents. They go to the school just for 6 hours. Moreover, they watch their parents since they have born and try to copy their parents without any teaching, they believe that what their parents do is the acceptable thing. For example, recent research revealed that 80% of the boys who smoke in their teenage life get influenced by their fathers.",
        "In conclusion, although a lot of people argue that schools are responsible to make their pupils a beneficial member of the society because they are paid for it, I believe that guardians are the most important factor in children\u2019s life because children follow their parents more than anyone else."
