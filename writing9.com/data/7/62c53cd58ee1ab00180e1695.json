        "It is true that some parents are overly permissive and want their children to have everything they want.I personally think that this is not a good parenting style and it leads to spoiling kids from the beginning of their life.",
        "If parents want to raise respectful and honest children,I believe they should enforce  certain restrictions and clear expectations.Moreover,they have to punish them if it is necessary.It is very important to be able to say 'no' to kids when they misbehave or do something wrong.This is the only way to helo young people  control their desires.In my view,parents who do the opposite actually are doing more harm than good.If we,as parents,provide  them with everything,they will get used to it.And in the end,they will become lazy.",
        "The children who have been raised by such kind of parents are likely to grow up with several negative personality traits.The first and obvious danger is that they will be dependent on their family as they have been provided for by their parents in their childhood.Next,they will become self-centred adults who show no consideration for the needs of others.A person who has never lived with boundaries is likely to lack  patience with anything that they will come across in the future.And it might lead to failure in education and job.Eventually, these kinds of personality traits  may result in disagreement in personal life.",
        "By way of conclusion,I once reaffirm  that giving offspring everything and letting them do  whatever they feel like will lead to serious consequences and the permissive parenting style is not a good option for raising kids. Parents should help their kids develop self-control and respect for others."
