        "Dear Sir/Madam,",
        "I am writing to express my dissatisfaction about the accomodation provided to me by the college authorities at Room 203 in the H1 boys hostel. The situation of sharing the room With John Owen is becoming very challenging day by day.",
        "John likes to party quite often and always invites his friends to the room. They drink and play loud music till late night at least 2 to 3 days every week. I have spoken to him regarding the same and requested him to party outside the hostel since it has started to affect my studies. However, this discussion could not help us come to a viable compromise.",
        "Emphatically stating, I am not able to concentrate on my assignments and study for the exams which are just around the corner. Being a competitive student, I always aim to score more than satisfactory marks and I fear that this situation will have a detrimental effect on my future. Moreover, I personally do not appreciate alcohol consumption inside hostel premises.",
        "I request you to provide another suitable accomodation with a student who is responsible and more into studies, which will allow me to concentrate better. As it is a very sensitive issue and our entire future depends on the way we perform in our exams, I am eagerly looking forward to hear a positive response from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
