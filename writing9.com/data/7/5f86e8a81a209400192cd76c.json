        "Educational Institution is a place where children learn something new every day. That it is a total waste of time to teach students various skills at school and should stick to their academic curriculum is a subject which provokes great enthusiasm as well as stark opposition and at times they both become somewhat blurred. There are strong arguments on both sides of the debate which I will discuss in upcoming paragraphs along with my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, those who consider extra-curricular activities at school to be a waste say that it could affect their performance in academics. Not only, could they lose grades by focusing more on such skills than the main subjects of study, but they can also get distracted from their goal to achieve best results in their examination by participating in other activities as they have to miss their lectures to become a participant in those programmes or games. For example, a student takes part in sports has to  miss his periods to do practice and become a member of the team. They also think that only if, the pupils will be kept away from other things that are organised by school, can they achieve a successful career in their life. Such as, parents pressurize their children to concentrate on studies and not utilising time on other useless activities to become a Doctor or Engineer.",
        "Conversely, however, people who support the organisation of other programs are as important as academics in educational institutions point to its range of benefits. It can contribute to becoming perfect in the professional as well as personal life as students can acquire more confidence, innovative and communication skills by becoming a part of these co-curricular activities. For instance, becoming a good leader later in life while working in a company can be attributed to all these qualities that one can attain only by giving equal attention to other things along with studies in the academy. Moreover, they opine that it is by participating in certain games and competitions organised by educational institutions that pupils can generate competitive skills and sportsmen spirit. As an instance, by competing in certain sports and quiz etcetera helps to make a person healthy and fair competitor.",
        "To summarize, it appears to me that strong arguments are in favour of encouraging the pupils to devote equal time to both academics and other programs organised by educational authorities. So that they can become a good citizen as well as better businessman."
