        "Artists often receive major financial support from the state, however, some argue that the national budget should be used in other relevant areas of concern. Although the artworks of such people increase tourist attraction, I believe that the government should spend more on the health problems faced by a country.",
        "One of the major reasons why the government gives a lot of support to these artists is because they attract tourists. Painters, sculptors and other artists are born with natural talents and they bring forth pride to their countries. The collection of their masterpieces is mostly displayed in museums where local residents and people from overseas can see and appreciate. For example, millions of people around the world visit the Louvre Museum, which is the home of the Monalisa painting, one of the finest works of the famous Renaissance artist, Leonardo da Vinci. However, I do not support this idea and consider it just a waste of money because the country should give more attention to other crucial problems.",
        "On the other hand, the national budget should be allotted to the nation's bigger problem like health. Many people who are suffering from various diseases do not come from well-off families. Most of them have poor financial status and do not have the capacity to afford medical treatment. Furthermore, the patients often complain that the government lacks the compassion to offer assistance for them to get cured. For instance, in the Philippines, a survey conducted in 2016 revealed that 7 out of 10 people die from critical diseases because they do not have the financial power to have access to the needed medical intervention.  If the government is really concern with the welfare of its citizens, then, allocating budget to provide free medical services should be prioritized.",
        "In conclusion, despite the fact that the support given to various artists results in a positive impact on tourism, I believe that government should be more concern in the health of the society instead."
