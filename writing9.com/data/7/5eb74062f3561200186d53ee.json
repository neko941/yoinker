        "Currently, people spend more time at their workplace.  Some people believe that working long hours has not only a negative effect on themselves but also has impacts on their families and society. However, I strongly believe that working hours should be restricted.",
        "",
        "We must acknowledge that working for a long time time has effected to relationship with family, and also lack of communication on society. This is because people do not have time to meet each others. For example, some people are working 12 hours a day. They spend time at work and transported more than 12 hours. These prevent people from family activities or having meals together. As a result, they may be broken up with their partner.",
        "",
        "Another fact to note is that working overtime might damage to as an organization. This is based on the fact that the brain has been used too much. For instance, a worker suffers from stress and depression. The mechanism inside the body gradually deteriorates. Consequently, employee will have less productive and miss communication.",
        "",
        "However, it should be noted that relevant companies or department should limit working hours for an employee. In this case, people should not work more than 30 hours a week and also well managing time. Prioritize tasks must be completed within each day. Therefore, an employee can be resumed to work effectively and motivation to continue working.",
        "In conclusion, we can observe that working for a long time become negative impacts to families and society. In my opinion, working house should be limited 30 hours a week. An employee will become work productive, effectively and they will be good in communication in organization."
