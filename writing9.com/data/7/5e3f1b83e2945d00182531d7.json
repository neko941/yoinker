        "It is often argued that in order to control the predicaments related to expanding traffic and pollution, the effective method is to higher the fuel costs. Whether or not, this approach is fair, is a debatable point because most of the people do not compromise with their daily commute medium. Rather a radical way can be adopted by the states which is to encourage pooling.",
        "Each individual wants to travel comfortably which is made possible with their choice of transport mode, be it a car, a motorcycle or a scooter. All of these are the basis of the catastrophic traffic and pollution, which is gradually leading to global warming. Imposing increased rates of petrol does not really stop people from using automobiles as most people would not want to keep behind their comfort, rather like to spend as much money as required for their commute. To illustrate, according to a survey conducted by the Hindustan Times, it was revealed that 70% of the employees working in IT companies still stayed with their mode of transport, besides huge increase of petrol rates last year.",
        "One of the viable solutions to decrease traffic and pollution problems is to create more and more awareness about automobile pooling. Suitable campaigns can be organized in each city to promote car and bike pooling which can help grab attention of people in a positive way, instead of creating negativity among people by shooting the petrol prices. Moreover, companies can identify the employees living in a particular area and assign them official cabs to discourage separate vehicles for commuting to their workplace. For instance, Uber, an automobile booking app, has introduced car and bike pooling recently, considering traffic congestion and pollution problems, and this has also given a chance to middle class people to share their commute costs among a group of individuals.",
        "In conclusion, on the face of it, keeping the prices higher for petrol may seem to be most apparent, but it does not sufficiently help in solving traffic and pollution problems. Instead, promoting automobile pooling can be a much better approach."
