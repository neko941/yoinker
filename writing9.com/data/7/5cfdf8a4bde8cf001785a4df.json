        "It is considered by many that rich countries ought to help poor nations when they become unable to meet their basic needs. I, personally, support with this viewpoint; in the following paragraphs I will discuss elaborately that wealthy countries should continue their help in the form of humanitarian relief in order to make a world with no hunger and to extend their business around the universe.",
        "Firstly, it is largely developed nations' moral responsibility to provide daily essentials to poverty-stricken nations. The help can be done by any means, such as, by distributing emergency clean water, food and clothes. Rich countries are supposed to come forward to change the lives of destitute nations because they ruled those nations in the past; by smuggling their wealth, they made them poor nations. Moreover, rich countries are now leading the world and they are now policy makers. To make a peaceful, happy and hunger-free world, they should help poorer nations so that these nations can prosper in every field.",
        "Secondly, usually, multi-national companies are run by wealthy nations. Those companies always look for new markets of their produced commodities around the world. If they assist unprivileged nations to progress their lives, they have a chance to extend their market in those nations in future. Because when a nation prosper, they tend to spend on luxury and multi-national companies can take advantage of this chance. For example, nowadays, China is assisting certain poor African countries so that they can extend their market in near future in those nations.",
        "In conclusion, developed countries ought to continue their humanitarian help in destitute nations not only it is their responsibility but also to increase their business in those nations."
