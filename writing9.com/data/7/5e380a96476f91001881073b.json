        "While it is thought by some that organizing exuberant wedding and birthday parties accounts for wasted expenditure, there are others who believe that such gatherings are important from an individual and social perspective. This essay will discuss both views and look at probable reasons for people to have such beliefs.",
        "There are a few reasons why such celebrations can be considered to be a waste of hard earned money. Firstly, a lot of food is usually ordered for such occasions disproportionate to the number of people actually attending the event. This is done in anticipation to avoid embarrassment, in case the food gets over before the guests are catered to. Secondly, there is a huge amount of decoration that is generally involved in making the moment memorable, which is mostly of a disposable nature and cannot be reused. For instance, fresh flowers are usually the item of choice for beautifying the auditorium or the room of party hall, which perish after a few hours. A considerable amount of money is spent in order to purchase these things for a one time celebration and thus compels one to reconsider the idea of throwing a party where money can be wasted.",
        "On the contrary, people have their reasons to consider expenses for giving a party a necessary affair. There are people who believe that the more one spends for holding a party, the greater will be the respect earned in the eyes of those attending. Additionally, it is true that unless such occasions are celebrated, there would not be a reason for near and dear ones to improve their bonding and have a good time. The birthday celebration of a 5 year old, for example, allows the child to feel happy and at the same time creates memories for the rest of his life.",
        "In conclusion, although it is true that money does get wasted in hosting big functions, such get-togethers are a necessity to create memories in one\u2019s lifetime."
