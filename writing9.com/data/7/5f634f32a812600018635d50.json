        "There is no doubt that the global tourism industry is thriving. It has brought colossal success to several cities, however, there is a suspicion that it would affect the locals and the surroundings. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support for the former view.",
        "On the one hand, the drawback of tourism could be that, it could cause friction between a tourist and the local community and it could also affect the environment adversely. For example, a holiday-goer may not respect the culture of the host country which may create disputes with them. Moreover, a tuk-tuk ride carrying tourists to several tourist hot spots may cause severe air pollution or loiter around could be detrimental. As a result, the environment is widely affected. However, with strict guidelines from the governments, such activities can be avoided and pollution can be controlled.",
        "On the other hand, my view is that tourism has proved beneficial to many countries. It has helped the host country by generating revenue from it. For instance, a country like Dubai, has progressed solely because of its tourism sector, with over 20 million holidaymakers visiting annually. Furthermore, it has created many employment opportunities for the locals and improved their standard of living.",
        "In conclusion, while there are disadvantages to international tourism, such as affecting harmony of the local and adding to the pollution, these must be weighed with positives of tourism, namely prosperity of the country and generating employment. Personally, I feel the pros outweigh the cons."
