        "Industries are a financial strength of any country which can be categorised as polluting and non-polluting.The polluting industry is a grave concern for every country as it impacts natural resources and public health. In this essay I will look firstly at how higher taxes aid in reducing pollution and then highlight alternative ways of overcoming pollution with appropriate examples.",
        "To start with, the government uses multiple ways to curb pollution and increasing taxes on the polluting industry is one of the alternative ways. With this approach the operational cost of the targeted industry automatically increases and in the end target industry died by itself. For example,recently Government of India made changes in the household sector where certain coolant gases will be replaced by green gases and the government banned the import of raw materials and put higher taxes on such products.",
        "There are alternative ways where pollution can be reduced in targeted industries.First, a proper transition model should be prepared by the government where green technology should be available easily to them.Secondly, an incentive sale model should be placed so that infused investment is achieved  before breakeven year.Third, buyers should be encouraged to buy green products in various ways, like 0% GST taxes on the product. Recently, the government banned the usage of single-use plastic and encouraged manufacturers to produce green products through various platforms like providing easy loans to MSME Industries at a substantial rate.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, governments should encourage polluting Industries to adopt new technologies and create awareness programmes for them through various platforms like scheduling seminars, creating lucrative policies, instead of slashing higher tax slabs."
