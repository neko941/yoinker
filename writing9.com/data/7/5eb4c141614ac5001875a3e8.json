        "Achieving a balance between work and family is important to everyone. Thereby, it is argued by some individuals that people should prioritize high salary when choosing a job to support the family financially. In my opinion, I think that the wage is the most important factor when choosing an employment to secure wealthy stability for the family. However, convenience and the working environment are important too. In this essay, I will shed some light on the given notion and discuss what factors matters while getting a job.",
        "First and foremost, workers have to fulfil their housing needs. To exemplify, every family relies on the contribution of working members to get basic requirements for family and pay bills. Sometimes they have to pay their family debt. People often take million dollar loan to cover their mortgage payment for house and kids'  education. Thus, graduates have a responsibility to pay back loans. Therefore, income plays a significant role to support the  family financially when choosing an employment.",
        "On the other hand, convenience and working environment are a key factor of work performance and satisfaction in a job. Having a workplace nearby saves a lot time to complete fruitful  things in a life. It also save money to some extent by reducing time to travel. Moreover, the employer and colleagues should be friendly and easy going on the work-site. It all leads to reduce mentally and physically stress at work. For example, a recent study at Toronto university showed that 80 percent of workers were satisfied with their job due to good working environment.",
        "To sum up, although, when choosing an employment, high salary should be on the top list to make contributions to the family financially, but other circumstances, such as working atmosphere and convenience  should be considered for balanced personal and professional life."
