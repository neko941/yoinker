        "There is no doubt that technologies are becoming more advanced and complicated each year. Driverless vehicles are going to be announced as the new generation of the transportation system. Although utilizing these vehicles has some drawbacks it can be much more beneficial if it is used properly.",
        "First and foremost, the major drawback of autonomous cars is that they can be affected by cyber-attacks. As these transportation systems are controlled by computers hackers can disturb their performance and cause damage to  society. Another issue is that exploiting self-driving vehicles can make many drivers unemployed  since there is no longer a need for taxi drivers or Lorries drivers and they should find another job.",
        "Turning to the other side of the argument, using self-driving vehicles has many advantages. Firstly, it can be helpful in decreasing the number of road accidents. Many accidents happen because of human errors, by utilizing computers to manipulate  traffic and transportation systems these issues can be solved. the second advantage is that people can be much more productive and useful instead of driving which is so time-consuming and exhausting. For instance, many employees have to drive to their work every day, so other tasks can be done during their commuting. The third advantage is that people who have disabilities can move independently. A group of people due to disability are not able to drive, so with autonomous vehicles they can go wherever they want.",
        "all things considered, novel amenities are provided to help humans have a more comfortable and better life. You need to weigh up the cons of Internet attacks by hackers and the unemployment of a group of people in a society, and also the pros of declining  car crash rates, saving much time and helping disabled people. Personally, I think self-driving vehicles can cause a revolution in the transportation system and it can be really helpful if  sufficient infrastructures are provided."
