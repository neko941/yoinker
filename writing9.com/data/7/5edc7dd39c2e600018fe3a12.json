        "How are you? Hoping this letter finds you in radiant and the best of spirits. I am writing you this letter to invite you to celebrate the national festival of India, Diwali also known as the festival of lights. While, we were studying in university you promised me to visit India. This is your great chance to visit India.",
        "Diwali is the best festival to celebrate with friends and family in the fall, month of October. It is celebrated to commemorate the return of Lord Ram, who came back to his birthplace after 14 years. We worship and eat sweets and food and later on we also burn crackers,the sky is full of fireworks at night. It is a lot of fun and frolic.",
        "I have talked about you a lot to my parents and they are excited to meet you. It would be honoured to have you as our guest for your entire stay.Moreover, we will revive some of the nostalgic memories of the great time we had four years ago when we were both studying at university. I assure you we will make it a memorable holiday for you.",
