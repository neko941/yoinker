        "The paradigm shift is growing rapidly, and it influences the relationship with family members. People have lived in different styles since technology and changing the perception of various things has given innovative methods in leading their lifestyle. Although leading life in a modern way has several advantages, the disadvantages are more than merits.",
        "To begin with, changes in lifestyle bring several benefits to people. In the past, people used to maintain their health sitting at home with taking care of their family, but now family members along with, friends go to the healthcare centre to make them healthy. As a result, interaction with near and dear ones helps to build a strong bond between people, which, invariably, attract them mentally and emotionally. Moreover, the tendency of moving forward with technology succours individual to communicate with the kith and kin. To illustrate, devices such as smartphones, computers, laptops- provide the easiest way to connect with friends and relatives, especially those who are living far away.",
        "In contrast, the demerits of changing lifestyles are observed in the modern era. The first visualization is that people are busy surfing their favourite websites so that they do not care to spend time with their family members. Another reason is that people have become obsessed with Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, et Cetra, consequently, do not bother to converse with others, even though in front of them some of the family members are spending leisure time. This attitude not only creates vulnerability in relationships, but it also forges misunderstanding among family members.",
        "In conclusion, people prefer to embrace the paradigm shift in most of the area. Of course, it has both a negative and positive impact on the life of people. However, the menace of changing lifestyle outweighs its benefits."
