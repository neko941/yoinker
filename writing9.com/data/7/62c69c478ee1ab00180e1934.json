        "These days, the issue of working and studying together is a widely debated matter. some people have thought that being capable of bearing own expenses while studying is a good habit. while others believe that it can badly affect the student's academic achievements. I believe that students should focus on one purpose at a time and do their best in their studies so they can be expert professionals in the coming future.",
        "To begin with, the study takes a lot of effort and time however, students still work besides studying. Firstly, they work to pay their high tuition fees and to give financial support to their family . Secondly, some students work to grab some working experience parallelly so, they can get a better salary after completing their degree. For example, medical students usually have so many exams and stress but they still work to pay their college fees and financially support their families.",
        "Moreover, today's students are professionals of tomorrow so government and individuals should help them financially so they can focus on studying and get better in their field. this can be done by giving grants and giving scholarships to needy students. furthermore, students should be given exemptions on their education loans. hence, they will make more focus on their studies.",
        "To conclude, few students focus more on jobs besides their studies and this is mostly seen because of financial problems. so society and government should help to reduce this burden and help them give grants and scholarships for their education fee. and this will lead to giving better professionals in the coming future"
