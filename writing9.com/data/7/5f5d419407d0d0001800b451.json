        "The world is changing rapidly so are the rules and norms  of society. When grown-ups of today's generation compare their childhood, they find that  today's children have more freedom then what they used to have. I believe that it is a positive  development. In this essay,I will support my  view for certain reasons.",
        "To start with, there are many advantages to children enjoying freedom. Firstly, juveniles are growing quicker as their parents did. This produces more liberal, adventurous and mature adults. Consequently, countries also growing  rapidly because the new generation shedding the traditional methods and adapting new  methods for  advancement. For example, in India, today's youngsters want a dowry free marriage and for that, they take stand against all the odds of the society. Thus, maturity makes a huge  difference in the advancement of  society.",
        "Secondly, youngsters are more knowledgable and well informed  as compared to their parents and grandparents. They know what their parents do not have access in the past. On the basis of their intelligence, they opt subject of their own choices and do not hesitate to take risk which further boosts their confidence. To illustrate, traditionally, people do not have knowledge about computer, accounting and other fields because of less awareness they just want to pursue their careers in the medical and non-medical field. However, understanding and  acquiring learning open doors of opportunities .",
        "To conclude, parents should not pressurize children to adopt their culture instead of letting them free to do something unique and different ."
