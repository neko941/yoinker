        "Many people think that it is a good thing to give a lot of knowledge as much as possible in research of science , trade and education field , while others  say that most of the  information is too  significant or so much  pricy to be shared without taking any charges from the public . According to my point of  view that government should decide which type of topic shared with the public  free or important for them . This essay explains both views with examples , followed by a reasoned conclusion .",
        "Some population opine that experts should give as much  information about science , business and study . The reason is that the main purpose of research is the development of individuals  so that it is linked with the welfare of  human beings.  To illustrate this  , if a new invention occurs in the scientific field about the latest technology or devices and new treatment for the hazardous disease , so they must provide all the clue to  people . In addition to this  , a  new business strategy is more helpful to smallholder businessman . Furthermore , whether a new method developed in academic institutions ,  will very beneficial to new educators and students .",
        "However , other people argue that some of  the news is so much important for individuals , therefore researchers should give this  free . The best example is that the invention of antibiotics medicines are shared all over the world , as a ,result many dangerous diseases are eradicated from  most part of countries . Another illustration is the semester method in the education field shared in 2000  and after that improvements observed in most of the results of students . Moreover , a new solution to improve the productivity of small trade is so much valuable for small-scale businesses in India.",
        "My opinion is that ministry should prefer  what type of advice is important  or not for persons . While  the sensitive or information  is related to the privacy of the country , this kind of message restricted for citizens . Therefore , they provide as much  intelligence and as free to  everybody because it is human rights and link with their growth .",
        "To conclude , the government can decide which instruction give or not to the public as  it's a question of development and rights  them . Thus , researchers of all department give useful news directly to individuals."
