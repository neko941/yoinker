        "There is no doubt that childhood is a crucial developmental period. Although it is sometimes thought that if  the younger students engage in salaried jobs,has many benefits, others consider that this  has negative aspects as well.  While having experience and earning money are the main advantages, this has some drawbacks as well.",
        "On the one hand, the first and foremost benefit of  doing a part time job along with study is that they can earn an extra income. In other words, this allows them to afford some additional requirements without asking money from their parents, eventually, they value and understand the amount of hard work  requires to get a decent salary. Additionally, when they work in a particular field, which assists them to gain a hands-on-experience, that can add an advantage, when they reach adulthood and searching a new job. In many developed countries, for instance, where students are motivated to join some kinds of  jobs, thus it is clear that this method has many advantages.",
        "On the other hand, there are few drawbacks are so evident while children doing paid jobs. The primary issue is that they may be exploited by employers. This is because there is no standardised salary system for  the young workers, and they may be forced to work  in a dangerous site, where may not have appropriate safety equipment.  In addition to this, it has been noted that these kids may  find it is difficult for them to balance school assignments and work-load, due to this, they may poorly perform in  exams. In India, for example, it is illegal to recruit children under 14 year for any kind of work so the negatives also so evident.",
        "In conclusion, doing  a salaried work would bring some merits but exploitation and poor academic performance are the possible side effects. It is highly recommended that by introducing a monitoring system to oversee children work can resolve any negative impact of this for a great extend."
