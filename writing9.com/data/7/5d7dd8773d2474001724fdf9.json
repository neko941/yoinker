        "Traffic problems and air pollution are major effective sources reason, according to other people. Every person wants facilities and they don't have time due to hectic schedules or city side job. Hence all prefer to use own vehicle to reach timely. Here, I really disagree with increase the price of petrol. At the end, I conclude with the facts.",
        "To begin with, today\u2019s generation very quick to learn and get better opportunities on the city side. Everyone wants to reach in short time. Price of petrol  increasing is not the way to reduce traffic problems and air pollution. Awareness of traffic  rules may help with this. Many congested areas are available in the city area. Hence may be unable to possible to use transportation way. Either use buses and train might be people reach late of the destination. For example, I was scheduled interview with a multinational company. I woke up early to reach in time to destination because of I don't have a vehicle. I was using buses, but it makes me late and I missed the interview and lost the chance to work with a big company.",

Poor people  can't survive easily with this due to they earn day-to-day income or take from others. Due to unable surviving poor people take the decision of suicide attempt. Also, Increasing price will affects of daytime to life resources.",
