        "Some folks argue that  social communication has decreased due to technological advancements like mobile phones. I agree with the above statement. The main reason for this is the availability of smartphones. Second is the convenience apps available for everything. I will discuss both the issues below.",
        "Technology has become so cheap these days that almost everyone can afford smartphones. Due to this, all people have access to the apps and engaging content available on the internet. So instead of going out and interacting socially, people prefer to spend their free time browsing through the content. Today there are many OTT platforms available that offer entertainment  almost free of cost and the content created is such that the user should engage himself and should be immersed in it. Social media has further decreased the need for social interaction. As everyone is available online or is a phone call away we avoid going to their place even if they live a few meters from our home.",
        "The technology is so advanced that we can have an app for anything. We have an app for food ordering, house cleaning and many such things. Using this app we have created a lazy workspace environment for ourselves under a false pretence of convenience. For example, when we go  grocery shopping in the market we can interact with different kinds of people, get to know about new developments in our area and create a bond of friendship with people. But as the grocery shopping app is available people give an excuse of being busy and order from the app. Doing this cuts an entire cycle of human interaction.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to say that due to the accessibility of smartphones, engaging content and apps available for everything we are ignoring the gift of human interaction. The innovations in technology are done for the betterment of humanity but it is being misused by many of us. So we should make ourselves aware of the correct usage of technology."
