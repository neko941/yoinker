        "Over the last half centuries, the pace of change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. This change has been driven by the booming breakthroughs in sports and art field. Consequently, people are now more encouraged to enter these two fields. But success in both of these fields needs hard work and determination. However, it is being suggested that only people with inherent talent can become successful in sports or art field. Contrastingly, some individuals claim that a person can become a good player or artist through learning. This essay will focus on the different perspective regarding how a person can be successful in sports and art field and why I believe that success in sports and art can be gained through both talent and learning.",
        "There are some notable reasons behind firm conviction. Firstly, no matter how talented a person is being born, if the talent is not properly polished, it will be futile. Talent can be polished through learning. For instance, a person may sing well by born does not understand the cords of instruments. By learning he or she can do much better.",
        "Secondly, talent needs direction and learning gives that direction. For example, no one born with the talent of playing instruments and later people learns to play instruments. Thirdly, learning encourages a person to be hardworking and dedicated.",
        "On the other hand, a strong argument can be made on the other side. If you have no talent, it will be difficult to get that much expertise through learning only, whereas that will be much easier for someone with a natural talent.",
        "To conclude, it can clearly be seen that the possibility of being successful through learning eclipsed the possibility of being successful through a natural talent. Weighing both the sides, I do recommend that both talent and learning is important to be successful. Many people try to succeed but only those who are talented and polish themselves through learning can be successful."
