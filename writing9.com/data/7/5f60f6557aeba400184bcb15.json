        "In the past few decades, online shopping has been increasing in many countries. Nowadays it is possible to buy almost every kind of product online, such as clothes, shoes, electronic devices and even furniture. There are many advantages to online shopping, but  regular stores provide a completely different experience than probably will never be replaced.",
        "The main advantage of online shopping is the opportunity to search for the product in many stores in just a few minutes. As a result, the customer can find a better deal for the purchase. Moreover, the client can buy products from stores located in any place around the world without leaving their couch and have them delivered at home in a few days. Consequently, you don't waste time driving to many stores to seek for the best price.",
        "In contrast, online shopping doesn\u2019t allow the costumers to try on the product and this can be an issue especially when they are buying clothes or shoes. In addition, when you need an item right away, online shopping is not a viable alternative, because usually,the products take a few days to be delivered. Also, for some people, like the elderly, that don\u2019t know how to use a computer or don\u2019t have a credit card, online shopping is not a possibility.",
        "For these reasons, I\u2019m convinced that despite the growth in online shopping, the regular stores have some great benefits that will keep them in the market. No matter how the technologies advance, sometimes the experience of buying in a regular store is everything that the shopper wants."
