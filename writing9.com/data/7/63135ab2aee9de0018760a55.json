        "World and lots of people will understand as time goes on why preventing and making illnesses and viruses stop is better than fighting them when they cause a huge problem. I absolutely agree with this statement because I believe prevention can make hospitals solitude and make biology science more bright and helpful for our future generation.",
        "If nobody gets sick there is no place for hospitals or emergency sections because people know how to treat dangerous viruses and illnesses as a result they do not have to reach hospitals. If hospitals were not busy, doctors and nurses can do their job in a better way and treat patients with more caution and equipment. For example, we could see what happened around us in two years Covid pandemic. Hospitals do not have enough space to take care of everyone, a huge amount of sick people were gathered in one building and doctors could not handle all of them.",
        "In addition, when doctors and scientists have more time to investigate and spend on anonymous viruses and illnesses they can find a way to stop that and find ways to deal with them before they involve human life. This investigation and knowledge will also help future generations of biology and can create a new gate for how to deal with abysmal illnesses and profound problems and pandemics. In the meantime, governments and scientists should do whatever they can to inform our future about pandemics and how they can be deadly.",
        "In conclusion, write this sentence with a gold \u201cPrevention is better than cure\u201d because we do not want the busy hospitals and hopeless doctors anymore when we can prevent it with spend more time and cost on it."
