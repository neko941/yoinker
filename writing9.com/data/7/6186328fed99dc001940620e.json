        "Although environmental conservation is becoming a vital concern for several people, the majority do not take it on themselves to go green and reduce their carbon footprints. It seems to be two leading causes and a number of solutions, which will be discussed in this essay.",
        "Possibly the main cause is due to people\u2019s low awareness of the severe consequences that are likely to occur in the future. There are many tv programs or even podcasts explaining environmental issues such as global warming, deforestation, soil erosion, and air/water pollution, but not clarifying their upcoming threats for our lives. Consequently, citizens do not take these issues as much seriously as it is needed. A further well-known cause is that we are facing more ecological issues than we used to. So many people are struggling to put a stop to their old-fashioned lifestyles and trying to promote sustainability. However, turning over a new leaf is believed to take time, and it is going to be a long procedure for all citizens to get the hang of co-existing with nature and the peripheral environment. Finally, it seems that there are also people who do not care about preserving natural resources and preferring their comfort to nature as they believe that their longevity is not that long to witness the possible threats. Examples can be seen in the percentage of travels by individual cars, water, and electricity consumption, not recycling waste.",
        "Turning to possible actions, an obvious step would be to establish communities in social media and programs on tv to clarify the devastating threats to alert the people who do not play their citizen\u2019s role for having a more prosperous environment. A second deed might be for governments to adopt new legislation and approaches to shorten the procedure of establishing a new lifestyle as in this situation, people are obliged to do so. In addition, each nation could consider some incentives for citizens and even factories to motivate them to promote sustainability. Finally, providing that both governments and citizens turned their attention to geological issues, addressing them all would be more feasible.",
        "To conclude, people\u2019s limited knowledge and lengthy procedure of quitting old habits appear to be the causes. Creating communities, considering incentives might ameliorate environmental problems."
