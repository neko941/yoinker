        "Television has played an important role in many children's lives and its viewing has been a favourite activity for many of them.  Watching television station can be beneficial   in many ways.  This essay agrees and  will discuss the development of a child's  intelligence  and awareness and also is a major source of an enjoyment",
        "To embark with, TV has a great benefit children as they get and connect about the physical happening in  their modern faced society. This is an implication that when a child watches a significant program that is educational,  informative and value  promoted shows will increase their   intellectual growth. For instance, a famous television show  'Bournvita Quiz Contest' telecasted by Discovery channel help children to improve brain power and  an ability of  reasoning. Another fortunate  development is an elevation in awareness  regarding different common   social issues. Many television advertisements and shows  raise voice  against problems such a as deforestation of trees and wastage of water, which help future generations to stay active and alert.Thus, the idiot box is very favourable to solve multiple issues.",
        "Furthermore, television box is both an educator and entertainer for children.  Many children watch television to enjoy and pursue their hobbies. Most common hobbies are singing and dancing and culinary activities, which are enhanced by watching different television programs for example, a famous singer has revealed that 25% of participants took part in the reality singing competition  are inspired by watching singer on the television set and without any guidance. Hence, the TV set is a great platform young stars to explore their talents.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to reinstate that television aids in overall growth of the child's body and mind and give many opportunities to consider their hobbies as career"
