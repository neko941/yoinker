        "Music is an inseparable part of everyone\u2019s life. Some people believe that music is a key to uniting different age groups with diverse cultural backgrounds. However, I generally disagree with this assumption.",
        "Individuals have various tastes in music mostly based on their age. A song that is admirable among adolescents may not necessarily be favored by youngsters. In my own country, for example, most adults prefer to listen to the traditional tracks of Shajarian while a majority of school students like Tataloo more than other contemporary singers. The reason is probably the genre of music and lyrics. Traditional music is mainly about ethics and love in its real form, but rap, which is truly popular among teenagers, is generally focused on current public affairs.",
        "Moreover, music is perceived differently by each society. Some may consider music a form of art, whereas others see it as a kind of entertainment or simply a pastime. The way people look at music in a European country is totally distinct from in an Islamic region. Even in a small community like mine, there are people who detest music since they consider it against their religion while others enjoy it a lot. Music has never been able to bring the people in my community together, people who share a lot of similarities. Therefore, I think it is not capable of unifying people around the world.",
        "Some people may assume that music may help people of various age groups and communities come together. They may argue that the same message is conveyed to all individuals through music. However, I consider it impossible. For instance, in Iran Dammam, which is a local instrument, is played in mourning ceremonies, yet outsiders usually consider it as any other percussion instrument used in parties and celebrations.",
        "In conclusion, I totally disagree with those who consider music helpful in gathering people together irrespective of their age and culture."
