        "Although it is thought by some guardians that mobile phones have tremendous detrimental effects on children's mental and physical health, other parents think that cell phones are not harmful for kids. In my opinion, I consider that children's fitness and academic performance, adversely affected by cellular phones' usage.",
        "On the one hand, some people believe that children should not use mobile phones due to significant negative impacts on their physical health and I agree. In other words, spending a considerable amount of time on digital screen could badly affect kids' eyesight and ultimately lead to weak eye power in early age. Along with this, children sitting with mobile phones generally avoid physical activities and sports that eventually lead to various health issues later in life such as, obesity, diabetes and several other illnesses. Moreover, children, who are using cell phones for the exceedingly massive amount of time, could get mentally disturb. For example, digital devices' access to kids leads to expose them to all sorts of negativity in the world in the form of heartbreaking, shocking and other news that could result in the serious mental disturbances and children could behave aggressively or could be in a shocking state. Furthermore, children addicted to mobile phones could not perform well in their studies. For instance, these days, parents talk to kids via social networking apps, namely, whatsapp and in the early age of study, children get addicted to get involve in chatting for long duration of time on these mobile apps. This, then negatively affect their academic performance in the school and result in poor grades.",
        "On the other hand, some people think that cell phones are having some benefits for children. One positive aspect is that kids used with digital phones can contact their parents easily at the time of emergency. To illustrate, children, who is keeping mobile phones, can update any adverse situation that could arise like lost in the city or experienced some kinds of accidents but these conditions are rare. Another benefit is that access to cell phone at an early age do their school homework, independently. As an example, nowadays all information is instantly available on google and its immensely helpful for children to retrieve any answer.",
        "In conclusion, While people may vary in their opinion, I believe that digital phones have extremely damaging effects on children's wellbeing  and school performances. Parents should think cautiously and ought not to permit mobile phone usage to mitigate the these awful effects of cell phones."
