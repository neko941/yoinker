        "Terrorism is the planned use or threat of the use of extra normal violence or brutality of national groups to obtain political, religious or ideological objects through intimidation from a large audience, usually not directly involved with policies made by terrorists who wish to be influenced. The issue of terrorism and brutal extremism has had an impact on the destruction in many countries in the world. In this essay, the author will discuss issues that arise due to terrorism and violent extremism for the states and provide solutions to resolve the case.",
        "The emergence of terrorist groups has caused several problems that occur in a country. One of them is where terrorists have a purpose that intentionally undermines democratic governance, specifically by trying to influence policy makers and members of parliament, and that threatens the state government greatly. Besides that, terrorism also spreads fear in people, people who live in the country feel insecure because of terrorism. Another problem is that terrorism is very dangerous to life, especially for civilians living in areas looted by terrorists because there are some terrorists who use civilians to be protected, because, in International Humanitarian Law, civilians have been protected in several articles. For instance, in some cases like what happened in Iraq, ISIS members who are terrorist groups use civilians as human shields to protect themselves from attacks by State forces.",
        "In overcoming the problem of terrorism, it is a bit difficult to provide a definite solution, but there are some efforts that might be made by a country, namely; the government should be able to provide political and civil liberties that cannot be burdened in responding to terrorist threats. In the same way of life, a government that seeks to protect the people to fight terrorism can be compromised by unlimited action; this can be defined as controlling well and carefully. And take proactive and reactive steps that are balanced and emphasized while maintaining political and religious freedom.",
        "In conclusion, Terrorism has become a global threat that needs to be controlled from an initial level. Terrorism cannot be controlled by law enforcement agencies alone. The world must unite to face this growing threat of terrorism. Now, let's hope that the world will soon be free of this danger. Without terrorism, the world will be a better place to live."
