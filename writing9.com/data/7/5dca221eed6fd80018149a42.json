        "Hi Dave",
        "Thank you for taking care of the house and pet while I am away. I wanted to drop a note to let you know about some important details. I will be in Fort Myers this week staying at Courtyard Marriott gulf coast town center. Incase you need me , give a call at 998567853.",
        "Tommy , my dog eats twice a day around 12:00 clock in the noon and 7:00 p.m in the afternoon and the dog food is present in the top most shelf of the kitchen. It would be very nice of you , if you can take him out for a walk every afternoon .Also please don't forget to cover him with clean sheets at night, otherwise he will catch a cold.",
        "Secondly please don't forget to turn on the motion detectors when you leave the house and turn it off when you are back as safety measure. Also the two plants beside the window need watering every alternate day.",
        "Even though I will be back in 7 days , it would be good if you can vacuum the house everyday as Tommy sheds a lot of hair which might trouble you.",
        "Thanks again for all the help! See you soon",
