        "It is argued that the administration should invest mainly in economy, I agree with this point of view, but, I disagree that the country ought to spend less money in community service such as health care and coaching education.",
        "There are a variety of reasons why supporting the economy is beneficial. Firstly, a strong economy will generate more job opportunity in our society. To put in another way, more people have a chance to contribute to national development rather than becoming a social burden. As a result, the way of living life increased significantly, it will be reducing the crime ratio. Secondly, A wealthy country is able to defend itself from other states. It can be investing money in upgrading military equipments which are defeat any enemies. It will be taking towards to the strongest nation.",
        "However, there are some advantages to provide welfare work like such as health care and education strategies. In the first place, when people know about there are full facilities, health, health care in the country, they will be more encouraged to visit doctors to have regular checkups. As a result, to detect serious diseases in the early period such as Cancer, Heart attack and treat well. This will result in improving public health, which is essential to contribute to economy growth. In the second place, those who are well educated as well as great knowledge in terms of their stream are possible to meet employer\u2019s requirements. This is because nation wants to boost economy, so they will be taking some well educated person. Therefore enhancing students savvy and skills are key to create a high quality workforce",
        "In conclusion, It seems to me that both the economy and education should invest can wisely because a prosperous nation can reduce unemployment and a great education system would be provide better employees in the  future."
