        "These days, many freshers, as well as experienced employee, struggle a lot for the job. While some think that the best option is often to keep the job changing, I, however, agree with those who think that the best choice is to remain in the same job throughout life.",
        "On the one hand, it is argued that the benefits of changing the work often a better choice rather than being in the same occupation. It is believed that the major reason for shifting the work is getting higher pay in a new firm. For instance, in a survey conducted in Mumbai found that 52% of employees frequently opt for a new company due to having a higher salary. Moreover, it is said that the foremost reason why changing the job frequently found to be beneficial is it provides a long-term career growth, resulting in facing new challenges and become great leader or manager in the new company.",
        "On the other hand, I would argue that sticking to one company for the entire life is advantageous in many ways. Firstly, in my opinion, it gives a sense of satisfaction in terms of becoming a manager or director in the company. It is true that any person who remains in the same firm for more than ten years always found to be in the position of manager, who leads or supervises the team under them. I believe that the major benefit they will get is the feeling of pride at the time of retirement. It is found that most companies always provide great send-off to those employees who spent their entire life, which is the greatest achievement in the life of that employee.",
        "In conclusion, although it is undeniable that a majority of workers change the job in order to get hefty salary and growth in the career, being in the same firm for the whole life not only does it give the status of leader but also the great memory and a sense of pride at the time of retirement. Therefore, on balance, I believe that one person should work in the same organization for their entire life."
