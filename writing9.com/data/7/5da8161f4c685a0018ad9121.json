        "I am writing to you regarding the incessant noise coming from the flat of your new tenant that packed in last week, Friday 14th October, 2019. He plays music every night and this is unacceptable because it is distrupts the serenity of the environment which is the major reason for choosing this house.",
        "My school examination will be starting next week Monday being 27th October 2019 and I need to study at night after my routine work. With this loud music, I would be unable to read despite the fact that I do close the windows to prevent the sound from disturbing me.",
        "I would be glad if you would caution him. You need to make him understand that there are other neighbours who might need adequate rest at night. Apart from this, I would recommend that you include 'the importance of avoiding a loud music at odd hours'  in your subsequent tenancy agreement with prospective tenants.",
        "Thank you for your time while I await a positive action from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
