During my visit with friends we had been into hiking with a group of people, filled with lots of fun and exciting to see the beauty of the nature. Apart from that, we also had a tour guide who took us to various places where we could photograph endangered animals and different plant species. It has lots of fun activities during summer season, but we had an option of skiing in the snow during our visit.",
        "Make sure you visit this place during the summer, as you will have lots of other activities available such as  hiking mountains, water sports, and camping. It will be a great place, loaded with lots of fun with other family members.",
