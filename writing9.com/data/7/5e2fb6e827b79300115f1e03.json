Firstly, this essay will discuss why it is advantageous to share and disadvantageous to share it with anyone. Lastly, state the opinion partially in the favour of both the notion due to various reasons.",

        "In conclusion, Information sharing can be beneficial sometime, but not all the time.Hence, everyone should take a precaution before sharing any idea or details about anything with other. This would be an asset in declining the criminal activities around the globe."
