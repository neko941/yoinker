        "In this contemporary epoch, there is irrefutable debate among folk about aircraft\u2019s have been increasingly used to transport fruits and veggies to some countries where such kinds of plants are impossible to grow or out of season. While it is possible to petition that owing to numerous upsides namely accessibility of fruits around the year. My perspective is that merits outweigh the demerits. In this essay, I am going to examine the given question from both points of view and then explain in the forthcoming paragraphs why I believe that the position.",
        "To commence with,  there are a number of arguments in favour of my stance. The most preponderant is that undoubtedly, aircraft has transformed in all aspects and presently folk prefer to extensive utilize it for carrying their basics fruits and vegetables to a remote area where It is not cultivated.  To cite an example, in the past we couldn\u2019t  export our products to other countries because of easy transportation, however, we also Couldn't  buy our needs from this country which was hard to grow. It also leads to improving a country. In addition to this, there are numerous other benefits in various fields. Thanks to the wide range of advantages it offers, not only does one benefit more when it comes to being effective, but they can enhance the productivity and quality of their lives with much ease,efficacy and convenience. Needless to say, all these merits stand out in good stead, as far as augmenting the chances of prosperity and excellence is concerned.",
        "On the flip side, another pivotal factor in the aforementioned proposition is that it is only likely to help one thrive and excel in varied areas. Using aircraft has  several disadvantages not only polluting our environment but also increasing  commodities prices.  For instance, when we export our crops to another country which needs preservation as a result many farmers use chemicals which also harmful to our health. The downsides of the stated topic are not undeniable.",
        "To recapitulate, by taking all the aforementioned arguments into deep consideration it is apparent that the benefits of aircraft are too great to ignore the demerits of any products in the current age. Although there are some non-negligible impacts of aircraft,  it is also vital for the countries where such plants hardly grow or are out of season."
