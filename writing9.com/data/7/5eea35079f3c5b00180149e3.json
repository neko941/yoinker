        "Owing to a sedentary lifestyle,  an increasing number of people are suffering from different type of illnesses, which are difficult to treat with modern medicines. Many people consider that traditional medicines are more effective and, therefore, encourage people to rely on an older way of treatment. I completely agree with this statement considering the effectiveness and cost of traditional medicines.",
        "A traditional way of treating any illness is probably way cheaper than modern medical procedures and medicines. In other words, most of the traditional medicines are made using spices available at home. Thus, very least amount of money is involved in the production of such medicines. As a result, these medicines are in the reach of every person, regardless of one's financial status, whereas most of the modern medicines are very costly. Thus, poor people find it hard to buy these expensive pills.",
        "Another  benefit of using home remedies or aayurvedic medicines is that these medicines do not cause any side-effects unlike modern medicines. It is proven that most of the allopathic pills can cause serious damage if taken wrongly with any other non recommended medicine.  Therefore, it is better to stick with the old way of treatment. Moreover, many modern medicines can sometimes make people addicted owing to the strong substances involved in that, but this is  not the case with home remedies as these medicines do not constitute any harmful chemicals.",
        "In conclusion, return to traditional medicines will help people saving their treatment cost and people will not need to worry about side-effects."
