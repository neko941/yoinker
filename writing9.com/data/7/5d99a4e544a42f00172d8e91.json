        "Admittedly, students importance of home based learning  has grown up.Some people believe that it is more effective than academic learning.This essay delves into why home-based learning better than campus learning.",
        "To begin with, individual learning  more convenient than curriculum education.To be precise, people get more learning materials from the internet and also they do not feel any teachers  pressure.Furthermore, easily access topics from University website.For example, the latest survey of Boston University reveals that nowadays different subject related applications available in Play Store and almost 60percentage of students studying with the support of this application.Hence, it goes without saying that self study more convenient than classroom learning.",
        "",
        "Moving on, self education method less costly than classroom study.To be clearer, in this present Era the study materials freely available in internet and travelling expenses not required. However, a pupil  studying in school those students  necessary to buy learning materials from the store and they also will pay the Travelling fee.For instance, the internet has different subject related websites and online classes only one laptop necessary for self-learning, but the classroom learning entirely different than self-study.Indeed, the student needs different subject related books and materials.Thus, it can be stated that the classroom learning more costly than self study.",
        "On the other hand, school-based learning develops different skills like leadership quality, organizational skills and communication skill. Additionally, the pupil gets more chances to mingle with others.Even if it is so the argument neither robust nor logical when compared with the multifarious benefits offered by the modern self study methods.",
        "To conclude,  it can be irrefutable stated that  self learning much more effective way of learning as compared to the school education.It is hoped that the authorities would concentrate more on such study method which will help students for an easy learning."
