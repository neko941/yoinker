        "Despite knowing the adverse impacts of over exploitation of resources, human beings are continuously utilising these to fulfil their selfish purpose.Consequently, the demand for the natural water sources has increased, in the recent years.It has become a worldwide concern.This essay will examine the possible causes associated with this phenomenon as well as some viable solutions to tackle this situation.",
        "There are several reasons for this rising issue, like pollution, population, and many more.But the major possible cause is an enhancement in the pollution level of bodies due to increasing industrialisation.Since numerous industries are set up these days, which emit toxic wastes.This waste is directly poured into the ponds and lakes.As a result, it makes it unsuitable for the drinking purpose.This ultimately, has lead to the scarcity of potable water, especially in the industrial areas.A recent study reveals that the number of people with the water borne diseases would rise to almost 20 percent of the total population, in India, which is quite threatening.Although there are various factors, which are accountable for this miserable condition, pollution is the prime cause.",
        "To get around this alarming threat, to the survival of living beings, it is necessary that the administrative authorities should implement stringent laws to regulate the flow of poisonous substances from the industries.If governments impose heavy taxes on the factories owners for their irresponsible acts, this can be resolved to a substantial extent.In addition, industrialists can be provided with funds for the installation of water treatment plants.Hence, some potential steps can prove beneficial in overcoming the present scenario.",
        "To conclude, it is irrefutable that individuals rely completely on the fresh liquid for their existence on the Earth and its demand is growing at an extremely fast pace.This essay discussed the causes, which should be held responsible for this serious issue, and the initiatives to control the further depletion of these resources."
