        "Whether, it is to book an air ticket or buy groceries, the internet has reached to the daily needs of every person. The advancement in the technology has made lives easier and prosperous. But, prosperity comes with a cost. There are pros and cons of using the technology to save you time. I also feel that, there are a lot of advantages of buying things on the internet, without completely neglecting the disadvantages.",
        "Nowadays, people are investing more on shopping, as the products are readily available at their fingertip. There are a variety of options available for the same product. Consumers can easily compare the options based on the public review. Increasing trend of shopping online also boosts the economic status of a country. The internet is connecting the globe, so people can easily endorse their brand on social media. This has a direct impact on an increase in the export and import of products in the global market.",
        "On the other hand, the internet has drastically increased the number of travellers across the globe. People can easily book their tickets online in a few minutes and travel to any part of the world. Recent records show that the number of travellers has increased dramatically over the last decade. This has also created some new professions like travel blogger etc.",
        "Though, internet has made life easier, it has also brought some security concerns. Nefarious people are luring consumers to buy defective products which are shown in a perfect shape online. Consumers are easily trapped into the fake offers and end up wasting their money. In addition to this, it is also decreasing our social connect. Earlier, people used to go to the shops to buy groceries or books. This was very helpful in building relationship with the shopkeeper. They also ensured that the product is not faulty or of bad quality, before buying. This resulted in investing their hard-earned money on quality products which lasted longer.",
        "Lastly, with some precautions and attentiveness, advantages of shopping online certainly outweighs the disadvantages. Moreover, consumers need to be careful while investing money online, read the reviews carefully and don't get swayed by the fake offers."
