        "Sports play a vital role in education as well as in a person's growth. Some individuals claim that sports in schools are a waste of time and resources, while others believe that it plays a crucial role  in education. In this essay, I will look at both views and  in my opinion, I think that any extra curriculum in institutions plays an important role in a child's growth, I will explain my reasons for it in the following paragraphs.",
        "On the one hand, there are many reasons why some men think that sports in education are waste of time and resources. First and foremost, due to engaging in games during their academic studies students cannot give their proper time and attention to academic subjects like English and Mathematics. Secondly, in schools due to games facility kids are more attracted to sports class compared to academics for just fun and because of that, they lose their concentration from their studies and, are also prone to get low marks in exams. Moreover, if people balance  both academics and sports periods simultaneously it helps them to get better success in life.",
        "In my opinion, sports play a vital role in one's life while learning. Firstly, games are a crucial part for every student and also an important factor for their studies, this is because playing sports helps individuals to solve typical problems and make their brain flexible, hence, children can do better result in exams. Secondly, it helps pupils to stay fit both physically and mentally. For example, playing football help students to fit  physically as well as mentally, which helps people to do their work more efficiently. Furthermore, sports also create a better future career along with education. Thus, it is proven that sports are an important factor for their studies and helpful for children.",
        "In conclusion, after considering all, I think that  any outdoor games are crucial for students and they should be part of education because it helps individuals to fit in both mentally and physically, and as a result, they get well in exams. However, schools should balance sports and academic lessons together."
