        "Dear Sir,",
        "I read an article in your esteemed newspaper in which the writer  mentioned  the town centres of my country. The article was very well written and provided a great deal of information on different shopping malls, restaurants, and many corporate offices. I really liked that it had details on different modes of transport which tourists could use to explore the city centers.",
        "However, I do not fully agree with the claim the writer  made about the town centers being very similar to each other. The town centers of Delhi and Mumbai may have some slight similarities but that of my city Indore is entirely different, as it is newly constructed and  very well planned. Unlike other city centers, it has  plenty of space for parking. In addition to that, it also features a stadium where a lot of international matches are organized.",
        "Lastly, I would like to offer a guided tour of the city to the writer of this article which may help them debunk the common misconception about the town centers of the country. As your newspaper is read widely, an article with correct information may help us boost the tourism of our city.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
