        "Dear Mr. Avery,",
        "I am writing this letter in connection with the piano which is played by you during the day and is creating a problem for me. I am not against playing a music instrument, but as I am a college student, I am not able to concentrate while studying because of this.",
        "This sound is very loud when you play it in the drawing-room because my study room wall is connected to your drawing-room wall. Owing to which, I am not able to focus on study after college. I have to wake till late at night to complete the assignments. Hereby, it is impacting my health and performance at college.",
        "It would be great if you could play it the other end of the house so that it will not be a problem for both of us. Moreover, you can practice it more at day time, as I go to college at that time. I think, in this way we can focus on our work without any disturbance.",
