        "Dear Mrs. Esperanza,",
        "I am writing to you to ask for a private course for my son to learn Spanish accurately. He has been studying it at school for two months, but he needs some extra help to learn the pronunciation of some consonents and how to use the grammar while speaking. Also, he has difficulty in listening, and I strongly believe that taking one-to-one lessons from a native speaker would be absolutely thriving.",
        "On the other hand, I would like to learn about your expertise in teaching the language; therefore would you please inform me about your highest level of education in this field? Also, I am curious about your methodology of teaching Spanish, for example, what kind of materials do you use in lectures?",
        "Finally, I would like to tell you about our available schedule. Due to the regular school times, my son is available at the weekends; however, he has been attending a swimming course for a while. Therefore, it is suitable for us to set the lessons on Saturday afternoons or at any time on Sundays.",
        "Thank you for your time and attention,",
        "Yours sincerely,",
