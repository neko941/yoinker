        "The prevalence of homework has been a growing concern over the past few years. While some people argue that it is unnecessary for children to be given practice by teachers, I support the view that the setting of homework brings various benefits for children.",
        "On the one hand, the major reason why people argue that children do not need to do homework is that because it creates unnecessary burden on children. For example, in some developed countries such as Finland wherein the top of the international educational league table which do not give home exercise to students.  Furthermore, many parents argue that their youngsters have already spent a long time in the class. They expect their kids should have more time for playing or physical exercise which can help their children release stressful, booting up brain development.",
        "On the other hand, I completely believe that there are various reasons why the setting of homework contributes a necessary role in the education. First of all, by giving homework to children, it will encourage independent learning and problem solving. To give just one example, teachers give a difficult math exercise to their students, which offer an interesting prize for student who can give the fastest answer. This leads to the fact that students will create more motivation for finding solutions and enrich their creation in the future. Secondly, by setting the task, youngsters can develop their studying habits which will be useful for them for higher education.",
        "In conclusion, while there are still some drawbacks on homework for youngsters, I believe homework plays an important role in the education."
