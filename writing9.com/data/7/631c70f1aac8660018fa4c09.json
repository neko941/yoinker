        "I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the heating system during my stay in your hotel.",
        "To begin with, my wife and I recently spent our honeymoon in your hotel from the 20th of September for a week. We are from Nigeria and had no knowledge it was winter in the United States of America as a result we did not plan for the weather. When we arrived in America, we realized everywhere was freezing cold. Unfortunately, your heating system was not working even though we paid for the most expensive room. That\u2019s a shame.",
        "To avoid catching a cold, my partner and I went shopping for blankets and winter jackets. This didn\u2019t alleviate the cold consequently, we had to move to the Kings Hotel at Park Avenue for the rest of our vacation.",
        "That said, I would like to be refunded as we had to move to a different hotel as your staff were unwilling to help. In addition, I hope you can fix the heaters as it could reduce the chances of previous guests returning.",
        "I hope to get a feedback soon",
