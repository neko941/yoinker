        "While some people believe that international news in comparison with local news are more significant. Others claim that local news is more important than international news. In this essay, I will discuss both side of views and eventually, I will give my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, some people believe that international news is very important. In other words, international news services can be more effective in acquiring information about specific issues. For instance, in local areas which are weak in terms of technical device for gathering information, in contrast, other international news site that have adequate facilities can support the news around local part more efficiently. Moreover, across the whole world, news sites are more sensitive and aware about what happened around them, so often they try more to possess more information. Also, if they get accessibility to kind of important news before others, it would be good for their reputation.",
        "On the other hand, it is claimed by group of people that, local news is more important than other international news. To put it differently, at the first steps local sites in comparison with other international sites have an accessibility for getting information about what happened around the local area.  News about the number of mortality in each local area due to COVID-19 virus, can be the supreme example of this point of view. In this condition, the local news sites are able to get better information rather other international sites.",
        "In conclusion, while there are convincing arguments on both sides of the debate, I believe that the local news is more significant and valuable than international news."
