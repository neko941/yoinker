Hence, they enjoy the beauty of mother nature at fullest. For example, in the north of Pakistan, few of the hikers explored a running stream of water, however, they had to hike a steep mountain for eight hours in order to reach their destination. As a result, now that place is a major tourist destination for local and international tourists and the government has also made a track to reach there. Therefore, the major benefit of travelling to lands with hard conditions is the exploring of virgin places.",
