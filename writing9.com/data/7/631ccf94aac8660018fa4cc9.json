        "Over the past years, it became a tendency that many families are migrating to other countries with different intentions. A small proportion of the population argues that  there are lots of advantages for their children once migrate to another region of the world and others believe that, they may face some difficulties. In this essay , I will discuss both points using examples from recent studies to demonstrate this and will give my opinion.",
        "To begin with, there are clear improvements in everyone's life if migrate to a better country. Many people change their places with the main aim of  a better life. In fact, pupils will get a better education through this . To illustrate this, the education system in Canada is different from India why because they mainly opt practical approach  to provide a good experience to students rather than a theoretical approach.  Moreover, this kind of way can make the students  acquire better knowledge and help to make them more confident as well as assist them to pass interviews. Furthermore, the choice of jobs is more in developed countries. Secondly , this kind of phenomenon helps to know more about various  cultures of different people from various places and helps them to learn more  languages.",
        "On other hand, there are some negatives to this. It is clear that, once people leave their home country they gradually start to forget the culture of their motherland. As a result of this, they get pressurize to follow other countries cultures. Similarly, because of this, people start to lose their familial roots in their own country. They moderately start to forget their family members, relatives and friends.",
        "In conclusion, in my opinion, migrating to a developed country has a drastic range of prons. I believe that  it is better to start a good career as well as live in a good place without forgetting the culture of the homeland."
