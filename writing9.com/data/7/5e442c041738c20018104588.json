        "The importance of rest, to the human being, is the same as other physical needs like food, water, and air.It is very essential to the human body for survival. Some people believe that sleeping is the only way to take a rest, Other emphasizes, regular exercise and playing games help to keep body clam. In this essay, I will scrutinize both the views before establishing any conclusion.",
        "On one hand, regular exercise and playing different games helps to keep the body fit and in some instances, they are used for relaxing the body. Daily workouts allow us to forget all the stress and bring back extra energy, Sametime it requires a lot of efforts and only focuses on the specific part of the body. If you want your full body stress free, you have to perform a different set of exercise dedicated to each part. Moreover, the wrong practice could cause an adverse effect and most of the time you must have a fitness trainer with you and it will hamper your budget. Furthermore, people prefer playing games to refresh their body. For example, If someone has a hobby of playing cricket, he would enjoy playing it to reduce strain and mental pressure level. However, playing too much cricket on the same day could cause a negative effect also.",
        "On the other hand, Sleeping is a very simple activity, it does not require any effort. Just close your eyes and you can get rid of all your stress, pains and all types of fatigue. From small kid to oldest person all can enjoy its advantages and keep themselves refreshed. In many cases, It was found that sleep cut down your diseases and help in speedy recovery. Moreover, it works as refreshment for full body, no need to focus on each part like in exercise and playing games. It makes all body systems up to date as antivirus does for computer systems.",
        "In conclusion, I would say that sleep is the best remedy to keep the body fit and fine. It doesn't have side effect like other means of relaxation also it is free of cost and it is inherent in everybody."
