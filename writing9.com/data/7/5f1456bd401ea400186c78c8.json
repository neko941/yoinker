        "Worldwide, tourism is regarded as one of the most significant industries which continues to expand rapidly. This constant and stable growth can be beneficial for both people and country which will be discussed in this essay.",
        "To begin with, with the rise in tourist, the host countries will benefit economically. Indeed, more travelling means more money which can be spent in part of the country's budget, so it can become a source of supplying money whenever needed. For instance booking, ticket and hotel, visiting tourist attractions and shopping are some areas that can draw money. Hence, it is obvious that if tourism industry increases, a country can have a more successful economy.",
        "On the other hand, this tourist industry has advantages for local people as well. First of all, for Sales people who can sell their products to curious foreigners. Cultural items in particular attract tourists' attention more since they are a symbol of their trip and can be kept as a reminder or given as souvenirs and gifts to friends and family members. Secondly, hotel owners can gain a considerable money since guests from overseas tend to stay for a longer time. And finally, people who are interested in a new language and culture can appreciate communicating with people from various countries. To sum up, a multitude of people can benefit either by achieving money or other kind of satisfactions.",
        "In conclusion, merits of tourism are countless and irrefutable for both countries and their residents. The economical aids and cultural impacts are among some benefits that can be resulted from this growing industry."
