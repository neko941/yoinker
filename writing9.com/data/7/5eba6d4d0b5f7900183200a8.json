        "Adults spend the majority of their day at work and while some incline towards the same occupation throughout their lives, others prefer switching professions for better career prospects; I, personally, support the latter view.",
        "To begin with, some employees stick to the same jobs because, not only, they thrive within their comfort zone, but they also, tend to have a good rapport amongst their colleagues; and this in turn results in a pleasant and stress-free work environment. Moreover, a common belief of  this group is that they have a better chance of being promoted to higher positions, in particular managerial, due to their loyalty to the firm. This is illustrated by a large number of American employees, who stay in the same organisation, often more than a decade, in the hopes of obtaining a status or race.",
        "Finally, one of the perks associated with a stable occupation is financial and employment security; that is heavily relied upon by some, either because they aren\u2019t equipped with a venturous, risk-taking personality or they have families depending on a regular, timely income.",
        "On the other hand, changing careers has numerous positive impacts, including thrill and excitement that it brings to one\u2019s professional life, as opposed to a monotonous  routine. Furthermore, it  adds two to an individual\u2019s knowledge and resume, as they constantly update and acquire a diverse set of skills, which in turn can open up new opportunities such as higher remunerations or a position. Additionally, feeling one\u2019s experience and skills aren\u2019t utilised effectively in a company can lead to young professionals shift enterprises,  take up more demanding yet  challenges and fulfilling jobs; often with more incentives.",
        "In conclusion, in my opinion. although staying in the same career provides some benefits, it lacks many other aspects, in particular innovative expertise that only comes with experience different career prospects."
