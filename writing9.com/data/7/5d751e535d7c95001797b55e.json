        "According to the data published recently, there has been a steady decrease in animal population globally for the past five decades now. In my opinion, I believe that there are, however, some effective strategies that can be put in place to help combat this menace.",
        "Firstly, in order to reduce the rate at which these animals are declining, it is essential to create animal rights groups. These groups will help increase awareness about the decrease in the population of animals and also educate the world about the importance of preserving the wildlife population. Furthermore, the government can also create laws forbidding the illegal killing of animals, and also set fines for defaulters of the law. For example, after the Nigerian government declared that any animal killer would be sentenced to three years imprisonment, there was a thirty percent decrease in the death of animals. Measures like this will help regulate the illegal killing of animals.",
        "Another point to consider is that animal lives can be preserved by the provision of an alternate source of protein for humans. One major reason why there has been a reduction in a wildlife population is that man believes the purpose of animals on earth is mostly to serve as consumption. In order to prevent this myth from spreading, the government has to create awareness about other sources of protein that are as good as the ones gotten from animals. For example, the US government is working with an artificial meat company which provides a burger that tastes exactly like animal meat but is not sourced from an animal. Once the government keeps sponsoring discoveries like this the need to kill animals for food will automatically decrease.",
        "In conclusion, although the wildlife population has been on a constant decline, this can be resolved through the establishment of animal rights protection groups and the prosecution of wildlife hunters, as well as the provision of protein substitutes to the human population*"
