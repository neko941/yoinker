        "It is a  proven fact that mind of children is impressionable and highly respective. In my opinion,young children are always influenced by people around them and observed their step in what they do. They always remember by subconsciously and behave the same things.",
        "Firstly,it is observed very commonly that parents may try very hard to correct their habits by to teach a lesson and also teach how to behave positively not to very hard. But in general,they behave in contrasting that they do not behave as their parents said. In daily routine,they observed their family members and subconceslly they remember all the thing  in their mind and by which they act the same as their family members do. They can not understand what they are doing and what is the meaning of it ,it is good or bad they can only copy the family members. In example some time parents are fighting with each other  then they observed and behave exactly the same which is not good for them.",
        "secondly, It affects their mind also. sometimes children observed only bad things and behave like that only then it impacts their mind. In some situation,they have a depression problem which impacts their mind badly.And they can not concentrate on their study also it impacts also their future. For instance,any resone in the family suffer from any bad condition and they behave abnormally they have no idea that it affects their children. other side children have copied from their parents.",
        "to conclude, children are learned a lot  from observing people around them and thus,it is parents job that to see them and behave properly whenever children are surrounding them. That is the duty of the parents."
