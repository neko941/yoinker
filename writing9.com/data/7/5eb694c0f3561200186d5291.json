        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter in order to express my concern regarding an urgent amelioration in our college cafe. Therefore, I would really like to request you to kindly publish an article in our college magazine in your following publication.",
        "I must say that I extremely adore this great place. I often go to the cafeteria in my lunch break with my bosom friends, and I personally love all the cuisines, which they have on their menu. In fact, I have been visiting this popular cafe since I joined this prestigious college. All the chefs, who prepare the dishes, are well- mannered, and they timely serve us food. Moreover, it is a fully- hygienic place with an extra-ordinary interior.",
        "Although I prefer to dine out at our college eatery, its prices are tremendously exorbitant. Some students, including me, are unable to afford them. I know that everybody would also agree with me. This hangout place offers some of its food items at a very higher rate as compared to other eating places.",
        "Thus, the authorities need to be scale down their sky- rocketing prices, so that every student could afford accordingly. Would you mind publishing this serious matter? I would deeply appreciate if you could do this on the behalf of all the students. If you do this, the management would think about to considerably reduce their hefty charges.",
        "Hoping to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
