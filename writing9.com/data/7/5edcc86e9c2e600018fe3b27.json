        "It is a common belief that scientific and technological progress in the last century has pushed forward our lives so far that we can live much longer than earlier. Best days of humanity are passing right now. I strongly agree with this statement because new ideas or things can help us to keep up with the times.",
        "First of all, comparing our activity with a hundred years ago, we can notice that in every area there are a lot of benefits. Everyone can easily buy a flight ticket and be anywhere in the world. No words are sufficient to describe changing in activity due to the Internet. These factors have made our activity quite simple than before. We can do some things which seemed impossible a hundred years ago. Our desires have a greater likelihood of being performed by our ancestors. Secondly, current progress allows to heal a lot of diseases which were death a century ago. New drugs are able to save lives much more effective and faster.",
        "However, despite human achievements in science and technology, humanity has a negative effect of this progress. In the world plenty of people die because of plane crash or car accident. These technologies simplify our activity, but do not ensure our safety one hundred percent. We still need to be careful.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that the best time is now. Our activity was never so comfortable and easy as one hundred years ago or earlier. Science and technology will continue to develop and make a better world."
