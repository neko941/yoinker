        "It is quite a debatable issue on how to judge the performance of any person. Nowadays there is not only a single method to assess student performance. So some people argue that only final examinations are a good way to evaluate. They also believe continual assessment like a class presentation, projects are not beneficial for results. I partially agree with this statement because there are several reasons for it. I will elaborate it in the next following paragraphs of this essay.",
        "First of all,  formal examination helps the tutors to check the ability of students. How much they learn or remember whatever is taught them to throughout the year. This method helps teachers to improve the performance of learners. Apart from that, the official appraisal has always done under proper supervision. Therefore, there is no chance of cheating. As a result of it, these exams enables them to perform better in the final examination. Along with this, they get a good grade in the class.",
        "On the flip side, casual evaluation such as course work, class activities, assignments and so on is also important to examine that which student is best in class. For example, if a student performs well during the whole year and he or she has a lot of practical knowledge, then, a teacher cannot ignore this factor when they assess his or her performance. Moreover, only theoretical information has no benefits if the student does not have confidence as well as practical knowledge about their work. Practical work enables juveniles to learn a topic deeply so that they can reach a peak of glory in their lives.",
        "To conclude,  According to my point of view, both examinations have their own value, students cannot be judged by only one method. Tutors should use both types of exams including formal examination and projects. I believe, children should be capable of performing in both formal and informal exams."
