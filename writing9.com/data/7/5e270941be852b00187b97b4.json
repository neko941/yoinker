        "I am writing in connection with a meeting which was organised in your hotel on the 1st November for the employees of the 'Avanta' company. According to the feedback given by the guests they thoughroughly enjoyed hotel facilities, particularly the outstanding design of the building and furnishing, as well as the quality of reseption and transfer provided.",
        "However, in spite of the overall contentment with hotel amenities the participants of the meeting reported being dissatisfied with the quality of food served for lunch. All colleaques agreed on the fact that the food was stale, especially bread and some of the salads, and the meat was tough and undercooked. One of the guests complained about having abdominal discomfort after the lunch, though not leading to any serious problems.",
        "Taking into consideration the abovesaid, we would appreciate it if you establish a better control over the kitchen and the cooking process. Considering all favourable reports that were heard about the hotel so far we are not going to leave any negative feedback officially. We hope that this was simply a misfortunate accident and the fame of your hotel will not suffer from it.",
