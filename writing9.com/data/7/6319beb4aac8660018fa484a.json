        "Some hold the view that rising fuel costs could be the most efficient way to tackle environmental  problems. I disagree with this idea for two main reasons. First, increasing energy prices will not have a significant impact on the amount and patterns of fuel consumption. The second reason is that hiking energy prices will create more economic problems.",
        "The first reason why I am against raising the cost of fuel is that it can not have a remarkable effect on fuel consumption. People cannot change the amount of fuel they usually consume since their lifestyle and daily needs cannot be easily changed. They have to go to the same places for work and other purposes every day. Therefore, the amount of fuel they demand for these needs will not considerably decline after rising prices. For example, a survey conducted in the United Arab Emirates has demonstrated that rising the price of fuel could alter individuals' consumption patterns in only 15% of the participants investigated.",
        "Moreover, making energy more expensive would pose more economic problems. The first area affected by hiking fuel prices is transportation, which plays a salient role in the economy. This will increase the price of other products and services, exerting a detrimental impact on people's lives. It goes without saying that this strategy will not have any meaningful contribution to solving environmental problems. For instance, a study conducted in Germany has revealed that more than 60% of environmental activists hold that rising the cost of energy is not an effective solution to their concerns.",
        "In conclusion, making energy more expensive is not the most potent approach to cope with environmental issues because this cannot change the patterns of energy use and will bring about further economic problems."
