        "It is argued that vegetarian people do not like to eat meat or seafood because they consider this unhealthy and advantageous for wildlife. This essay will explain both the statements as well as provide my point of view about this interesting topic.",
        "Many vegetarian people assumed that eating meat or fish is harmful for their self-fitness. I partly agree with this view because meat contains proteins and fish has omega fats, which is a vital need of the human body for the proper functioning of body cells. For instance, Proteins and omega fats regulate body processes, transport materials throughout our body, help our immune system and act as a source of energy. Despite all these benefits, we cannot deny the fact that meats also consist of saturated fats, which results in detrimental health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and cholesterol.",
        "However, I agree with the second point that many non-vegetarian have opted for a vegan diet since numerous animals were being killed to source their body meat. Because of this, animal and sea creature\u2019s population have reduced dramatically, affecting our natural habitat. A research of World Health Organization report in 2015, over 70% of animals were killed in Africa, to fulfill meat appetite of only 30% of the local population.",
        "In conclusion, some people indeed believe that being a vegan is healthier than a meat consumer, and further impose a positive effect on the environment. To a certain point, I would agree with it, but meats and fish also contain certain types of nutrition that are needed by our body. I do believe that if we could balance the consumption of meat, fish and vegetable, it would make our body become healthier than the vegetarian."
