        "I thought you should know about the problem that I experienced last week during my stay at your hotel. Television in my suite was not working.  I asked for help to the hotel staff, but they were not able to turn it on.  I hope we can agree on a way to solve the problem.",
        "The problem was about television. When I tried to turn the television on at night, it was not working. I like to watch a T.V. series, which comes at night every Sunday. Since I stayed at the hotel on last Sunday, I missed the whole episode.",
        "When I tried to seek help from the staff members, they could not do anything. They said that the electrician has a day off, and they do not have any idea how to repair the television. Although they tried to unplug and plug wires, they were not successful in turning the television on.",
        "In my opinion, you should hire two electricians. When one electrician has a day off, another one can address such issues. As a result, guests would not face difficulties that I faced last Sunday.  Since the hotel charges a lot to the guests, we expect the best services from the hotel.",
        "I hope you are willing to accept my solution.",
