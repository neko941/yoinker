        "In the modern world, folks tend to travel more than in the past decades. A reason is that globalization influenced being more interested in different cultures and countries. In that way, mobile applications are used by travellers to communicate with others. In stark contrast, some others prefer having classes of languages. I too totally agree with this view and the reasons for my inclination are explained in trailed paragraphs.",
        "In the beginning, millennial groups are used to technology. In other words, when they are in trouble, they like using their cellphones for the internet and have quickly the answer. It has been surveyed by the local newspaper that, folks used mostly apps for almost every type of travel service because it is the fastest and the easiest.",
        "Nevertheless, learning new languages benefit tourist in the cultural and social aspect. To explain, the moment when students were introduced to  learning  a new idiom, they simultaneously know about the food and manners of the country. For example, an article from a local newspaper said that knowing the way of living and popular dialects have the advantage of not being lost in a foreign country. Therefore, having language classes is an advantage to visiting new cities.",
        "In summary, I think studying in idiom shools is amazing in order to know more about the country you want to visit and to speak clearly with the natives. Furthermore, the usage of an app maybe is a useful tool to search about words you do not understand. After a thorough analysis of this subject, I suggest if someone wants to  learn about its language and having a dictionary mobile application with them."
