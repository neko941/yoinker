        "It is said that in Britain, elderly people tend to live in elderly  care homes where  caregivers are available to take care of them.On several occasions, the state has to bare the cost of this.I believe that the government needs to pay this type of service due to older people had already paid a high amount of money as a tax to the state and serviced  to their society during their working age and nursing of elders is too expensive for  families.",
        "When a person gets older, they need  support from someone to look after them because most of them have several health problems and physical weaknesses .However ,the government should not forget the contribution of these people to the country's development when they are young and how much they have paid to the government as taxes.If they have saved that money in their savings account,that would be enough to live a comfortable life in their older age and look after themselves.For instance,in the UK,every employee must pay an income tax and for health insurance and I believe that part of this pay should allocate to look after when they  aged.",
        "Another significant reason that the high cost",
        "of the elderly care service .If the government does not pay for this,then families have to pay the bills of health care and personal assistance care for elders.This is very costly to afford for the family as they also have a high cost of living as taxpayers.For example ,  recent research done by a charity in London revealed that an average nursing care home cost for an individual is nearly the full cost of living for a couple in  London.",
        "To conclude,I think that older people need to be taken care of by the government as they have served their country and paid taxes during their working age,while elderly care cost is highly expensive for families ."
