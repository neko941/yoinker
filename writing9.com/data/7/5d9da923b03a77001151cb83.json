Other possible strategies could be imprinting statutory warning over the packets of these junk foods that stating the adverse effects of consuming this, moreover, under no circumstances do not advertise these food commercials not only on television, but even any printed media also. Those who are breaking this law, must be served  a long jail term to set an example for others.",
