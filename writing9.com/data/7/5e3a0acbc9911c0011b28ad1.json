        "Knowledge can be obtained either by reading books or by practicing in daily life activity. Whether knowledge gained by reading\u00a0is more valuable\u00a0than that by practicing depends on the social status, professional occupation and the stage of an individual's life. The essay will compare and contrast them and then will present my opinion.",
        "From the ancient time to the contemporary era, books are\u00a0primary resources of knowledge for people, especially\u00a0professionals. For example, becoming\u00a0a doctor, a lawyer or a\u00a0scientist includes long-period\u00a0theoretical education in classes. Without mastering the essential principle, it is impossible for doctors to treat their patients, for lawyers to go to court, and for scientists to\u00a0invent more high-tech items. Then all these professionals will continually hone skills during their practice. However, practical experiences are more crucial to certain occupations, such as\u00a0plumber, wielder, and so on. They gain their skills and master the essential core knowledge by on-hand\u00a0training or during their apprenticeships.",
        "Although both books and experience are fundamental sources to\u00a0gain wisdom,\u00a0knowledge obtained by reading\u00a0is significantly different\u00a0from that by\u00a0practicing.\u00a0Reading textbooks, guidelines and research articles is a fast and convenient method to gain\u00a0knowledge. Moreover, content gathered and documented in all these books are precise and reliable. While, skills learned during hand-on practice\u00a0may be easy for learners to understand and last long in their memories. However, they are limited to person and various among individuals.",
        "In terms of education, I will definitely advocate that\u00a0learning from books for principles and theories\u00a0are crucial for pupils and help them to be ready for further studies in high school and then in universities. After graduating from universities, real-life practice in an individual's\u00a0career will help polish them wisdom and create novel ideas as well."
