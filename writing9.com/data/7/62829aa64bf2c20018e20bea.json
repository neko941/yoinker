        "I am writing this message in response to your acquiring about the weekend cookery course. First, I would like to congratulate you on the amazing Italian cuisine course, I have not expected to meet up with such a lively and funny class. All the students were definitely motivated whichl inspired me to feel free over the 30 days, and to create quite a wide range of new Italian recipes.",
        "Besides the incredible peers, our teacher, Mr Ruan, was really attentive, and although he had a lot of errands to run, he tried to encourage me all the time with such  wonderful suggestions. The best of our classes were created by Mr Ruan due to his geniality.",
        "In addition, after learning some special tricks to cook pasta, and because of my self-confidence, I came bold enough to make pasta for my father's birthday dinner last weekend. It turns out that it was a huge success! My parents have never tried something like that. Therefore, they loved it and they are wondering to taste my Japanese desserts or whatever else.",
        "By the way, last but not least, I would  like also to suggest a new subject for our next course. It would be a dream to navigate over the Asiatics desserts, maybe next month? I think that would be wonderful.",
