        "Nowadays, teaching a child has become a controversial topic. While some individuals believe that it is important to teach cooperation, I consider that it would be much more beneficial to promote competition among children.",
        "On the one hand, there are reasonable arguments for why some people support cooperation. The first argument is friendly relationship. This means if we encourage children to learn a collaboration, it would be handy for their future, they will learn how to communicate with people in the community in a friendly way. Moreover, the supporters of this argument, acknowledge that teaching a sense of cooperation at school for children provides fundamental skills of working in a team. As a result, when they get older there would not be any problem associated with working in a team, and they could easily get a job. Therefore, cooperation plays a crucial role in children\u2019s education.",
        "On the other hand, my personal standpoint is that competing is a key to making higher profits in every ground of business and other organizations also, for a variety of reasons. While I concede that cooperation might keep people together and enhance understanding of each other well, I accept that fierce competition is vitally important at work since it increases the productivity and a yearly income of the organization.  To illustrate, a sense of competition electrifies every worker of the staff and encourages to work independently. For that reason, the whole staff tries to generate something new and comes with brilliant ideas because they will be rewarded for their innovation that is useful for the company\u2019s success. By contrast, this is not the case with cooperation because not all workers in the same level in the group, there would be one leader who is responsible for the whole staff and all the decisions made by him. So that, in my opinion, school children should be taught competing as it leads to success and self-development.",
        "In conclusion, although there might be some advantages of cooperation, it is advisable to promote a sense of competition for the aforementioned reasons."
