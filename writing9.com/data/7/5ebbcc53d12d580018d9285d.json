        "The role of music is considered to be significant by a group of people; while others believe it merely a type of relaxation. I think music is crucial because it gives us a hint of culture and history about a particular society; however, it cannot be denied that it acts as healer for an individual when depressed. This essay will discuss both views followed by the importance of music in any community.",
        "On the one hand, music is one of the most common sources of entertainment, and capable to change our mood, which can alter our emotions. As a result, several people play songs to reduce their stress at work. Additionally, it is considered as an adequate source of mental peace which helps us to focus on activity even in a stressed environment. For example, generally, sports persons start their workout after turning on to the music of their interest because it helps them to forget about the pressure of their practices. Thus, it provides harmony and stress-less atmosphere from a hectic and tiring schedule of the day because of its healing power.",
        "On the other hand, besides its refreshing property, the place of music in history cannot be forgotten; moreover, different types of tunes and vocal instruments tell us about the civilization and diversity across the globe. For instance, Tabballa, a type of medium-sized musical device, belongs to the North India, and have found its roots in royal families of Agra. Furthermore, it helped the musicologist to anticipate about the interest of kings and queens of that era. Therefore, various aspects of history have been discovered through the type of music and musical instruments found by historians.",
        "To conclude, although in recent years music being mainly related to the enjoyment due to the global trends, however I believe it is tremendously essential for nations since it allows us to understand our heritage and tradition. Nonetheless, besides its historical influences, listening to a melody act as a stress-buster for every human being."
