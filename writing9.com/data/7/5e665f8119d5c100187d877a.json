        "Nowadays, Population is immensely increased due to this there is a chance of pollution So,People are likely taught to use cycles in the cities for this government should spend money to aware of bicycles. Some points out that they mainly should focus on public transportation, which is so beneficial to local people.Let's discuss the both sides and which will be elucidated in this essay.",
        "To commence with, How the technology is growing in the same way the overpopulation as well. The authority is likely to promote the green culture by promoting bicycles. To exemplify, Children going to school by cycle are diurnal because of this there is no pollution. It's better for government to give free cycles to the cities  However  we can reduce the cost of the cycle too. Impending days it is quite helpful to control pollution this could be done by us by using low pollution vehicles. When it comes cycle we do not worry about damage, pollution or repair.",
        "On the other hand, This is a good chance of developing public transport if state tends to do. For human beings trains and buses are quite useful for travelling long distances. For instance, for the middle class people are likely live in one place and commute to work at long distances for the sake of them government should invest some money on trains and make them clean every day which attracts a lot of local people In addition to this same for bus also.More ever, They can have buy more buses for peoples' welfare. There is a chance of increasing economy. Authority improving the transport facilities idea is incredible which helps a lot of travelling people.",
        "In conclusion, Developing cities should  focus on transport facilities because they are likely to move from one place to another place. For the people who are travelling short distances best to use bicycles. I personally feel the state should spend money on both moreover, best to spend on public transportation it is more helpful."
