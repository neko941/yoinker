        "Educational success is determined by the final position achieved by the student as per his labour and tenacity to work throughout the years. While some people consider that achieving success depends on the hard work and honest effort of the pupil others believe that methodological teaching by a proficient educator from the very beginning of study plays the main role. Here both of the points are elucidated with an explanation.",
        "As one may think that scoring good marks needs a lot of strenuous effort from the junior it is true indeed. Being obedient to the advice of the instructor and truthful to oneself can surely make things easier to crack. It also depends on the moral character of the pupil. Apart from the learning schedules and away from the eyesight of the coach, how one keeps on practising without giving up is important. Practice makes a man perfect and it needs someone to be very focused, devoted and aimer to perform it with continuity. It can be clearly observed in a class. A teacher shares the same educational lectures with every student present inside the room but the results are never alike. Some score very good marks in the examinations while the others are not so well performers. A coach always tries to teach his disciples in fine and exciting ways, but the performance depends on the learning capacity of everyone.",
        "On the contrary, the other group think that a good supervisor for the scholar from the earlier days of childhood makes a huge success. A tutor imparts knowledge to the students. If a lecturer has a keen subject knowledge, it imbibes easily to the followers. A supervisor can also direct the pupil in the proper ways with guidance and subjective opinion. We have seen many good teachers like Socrates, Galileo and Archimedes have resulted in producing scholars as their disciples. Additionally, a good skill in delivering knowledge, speech and personality attracts the students. From the initial, students like to follow their tutor if he seems motivational to them.",
        "Considering both views, I will like to support the opinion of the graduate's character corner. Though an instructor can make a good effort, it needs a good dedicated scholar to change the efforts into action. As a result, a strong motivating aspect of the junior is a more important role player. So the stiffness of nature is undoubtedly an important corner to consider even before the skills of the tutor."
