        "It is argued that nature world has no importance in today's time since folks are lacking about the knowledge of the natural world. I believe that the masses have become irresponsible and careless towards the environment. This essay will highlight the causes behind this situation and also provides the effective solutions to educate people about this issue.",
        "To begin with, first and foremost reason behind this issue there is huge negligence in human behaviour. They use plastic bags in their daily life. As we know, these plastic stuffs play a prominent role in destroying the beauty of nature and making the environment worse. For example, uneducated people burn these plastic many toxic gas releases from this burning items which are harmful to the society. Secondly, excessive usage of private vehicles generate problem of air pollution and damage the fresh air by discharging detrimental gases like carbon-dioxide which creates harmful diseases like blood pressure and breathing problems. Moreover, deforestation is major concern cutting trees and constructing buildings in the forest is like taking the shelter and food of animals. As these fauna play vital role in maintaining balance on earth.",
        "In contrast, there are many solutions to diminish this issue. One approach from the government should be banned the plastic producing companies by imposing heavy taxes and educate them bring changes like, usage of the recycling process. And also, awareness campaigns should be organised in which knowledge and the importance of nature should be guided to society and motives them to bring change and to make improvements in maintaining the beauty of nature. By cultivating trees in the society. In addition, authority needs to distribute the funds for forest department to protect the life of flora and fauna. By providing them food and medical treatment.",
        "In conclusion, it is true that, human behaviour is the main reason of destroying the beauty of the world. But there are some possible measures which are discussed in this essay need to initiate for maintenance of the environment."
