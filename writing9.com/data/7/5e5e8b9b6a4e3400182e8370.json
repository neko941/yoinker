We have stopped caring about the important tjibgs and that is why divorse rates are so high and family bonds are not strong anymore:our value system is disintegrating. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",

        "Nowadays, many people are interested towards vehicles which are attractive and also fashionable items like jewellery and trendy clothes. But, the caring towards the family or work related aspects are drastically coming down with which there is an increase in the divorce cases and worsening the bonds.",
        "Firstly, public view regarding the materialistic things and also the trendy items must be according to their needs but not to their greeds. This change can bring many changes in one's life. For example, one can spend more time spending with their family members, by focusing on their needs through eradicating their distraction on extra things which are not that important in life when compared to family and relationships.",
        "Secondly, one should keep in mind that, it is unnecessary to crave for things which are not permanent in their lives. These cravings don't only distract us from relationships, but also tempt us to spend more money, which will at last become useless if they are more than a need. For example,  keeping an eye on extra things will obviously make us spend money more, through which there is a chance to loose control on spending money. And also, this will make people more optimistic.",
        "Summarizing the above points, though the trendy items attract us to focus more than need,  they will adversely affect one's common life by seperating them with their partners or family. This obsession will also lead us through spending more money than needed.I conclude that our ethics and values are becoming disintegrating, which is an adverse effect on society."
