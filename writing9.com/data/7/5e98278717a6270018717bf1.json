        "It is indubitable that nowadays both adults and children are addicted to fizzy drinks. This  dramatic  increase  in  the intake  of  sugar-based  drinks  have caused  adverse effects  on  the  well-being of individuals.  In  this  essay,  I  shall  analyse  some  of  the reasons for high intake of sugary drinks and further provide with viable solutions.",
        "To  begin  with,  it  has  been  noted that most  teenagers are  more  likely  to become addicted to  fizzy  drinks;  this  is  because  of  the  modern  interactive  advertisements. Companies  invest  huge amounts of  money  to  advertise  their  drinks, but  with misleading or hidden information on the nutritional values of the drinks. For instance, a  recent  survey  showed  that  80%  of  the  children  have  minimal  information  on  the side  effects  of  these  drinks.  As  a  result, such  children  have  weak  immune systems and they are prone to fall sick more often. One of the ways to tackle this problem is to  introduce  strict  laws  and  impose  heavy  fines  on  such  companies  which  mislead the  people  with  false  advertisements.  In  addition,  such  companies  should  also advertise the harmful effects of excessive intake of their products.",
        "Another  reason  for  this  dramatic  increase  is  due  to  the  usage  of  artificial  additives and  high levels of  sugar  by  food  companies  to  enhance the taste of  their  drinks. Consequently,  people  are  more  addicted  to  these  drinks  because  of  the improved and sweet taste.  For  example,  people  with  high levels of  sugar intake  are  overweight and  usually  have  serious  health  problems.  To combat  this problem,  schools  and health  centres  should  educate  people  about  the  negative  impacts  of  high  sugar intake.  Moreover,  healthy  drinks  should  be  introduced  with  no  artificial  additives  to decrease the level of overall intake of sugary drinks.",
        "In conclusion, drinks with high levels of sugar have caused serious consequences to the physical  and  mental  health  of  people.  Governments should  not  procrastinate with the implementation of new laws and imposing heavy fines on such companies which produce unhealthy drinks."
