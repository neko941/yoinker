        "Some people belief that reading improves language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.",
        "To begin with, books use text to convey ideas as there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one\u2019s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.",
        "Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one\u2019s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn\u2019t always easy because the viewer\u2019s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.",
        "In conclusion, I believe people who love to read to have a more active imagination and  than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context"
