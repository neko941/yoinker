        "On the other hand, lawmakers low salary levels have many drawbacks. Such as, corruption and abuse of state property. For example, even politicians have to maintain their status and fame, Since, in the expensive election propaganda, congressman get involved with illicit business men for funds. As a result, MP's end up as professional criminals with their legal power. Finally, a decent revenue, according to the congress men's experience should allocate to reduce the negative development of corruption.",

Although, influenced political representatives wealth is earned by corruption due to lack of legal salary revenues. I think, suitable salary incomes should be allocated to keep them away from fraud."
