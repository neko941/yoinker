        "Certain professionals argue that schoolchildren should launch to learn overseas languages at primary school as opposed to secondary school. I firmly agree with this statement of experts and I believe that merits of younger people learning languages outweigh drawbacks.",
        "Learning foreign languages at primary school has several benefits. Firstly, youth are more flexible, eager to be acquainted with ignorance things compared to adolescents. Secondly, long-lasting learning and exercising assist to them have more self-confidence by speaking a foreign language. Thirdly, schoolchildren have the opportunity to participate in international programmes without any stress by speaking fluently a foreign language. For example, many teenagers from Lithuania attend projects and present presentations in a foreign language as they would be native speakers.",
        "On the other hand, starting to learn other languages at primary school has some weaknesses. One of them would be that a school curriculum possesses a multitude of subjects, such as mathematics, history and chemistry, sometimes a schedule has been overcrowded. In other words, if teachers added other subjects to a timetable of children, schooling would be frustrating for youth and schoolchildren would suffer from stress leading to many mental diseases, namely depression or loneliness. Moreover, adolescents are more self-assured, well-educated persons and these inherent characteristics of teenagers has always allowed opting appropriately foreign languages, which they really have the willingness to study.",
        "In conclusion, the benefits of learning a new language at primary school outweigh drawbacks. I completely perceive that it is meaningful to study a foreign language, while people are younger on account of the fact that it improves their communication skills."
