        "Nowadays, air travel is common by majority due to cheap rates of  tickets  specifically for international holidays.However, this results in various problems such as noise, contamination of the weather and renovations of the airports across the world.I consider this trend need to be curbed by authority to protect our planet either by imposing heavy taxes on aviation or by some other appropriate method.this essay will examine the impacts of taxation on air traffic and its consequences on community recreational tourism.",
        "On the one hand, due to hectic lifestyles, people find it very convenient to travel abroad for spending holidays.Fortunately, this travelling abroad cost very low nowadays due to competition among aviation companies.So the world has been limited merely because of very cheap air tickets.For instance, a recent survey by the UK Government displayed that tendency of people to travel for the holidays has outnumbered the visits done for business purpose.Consequently, its all possible due to low cost air tickets.",
        "On the other hand, there are several issues which are connected with this cheap air travel.",
        "Firstly, consumption of an abundance of fuel for planes which lead to environmental pollution.Secondly, the noise related problems seen during starting of engine of planes.So considering all these drawbacks, authorities should impose heavy taxes on aviation to avoid the adverse effects.I believe this would be a very positive step in doing that to protect our climate from these problems.Definitely, number of visitors and visits will be curtailed after this step and it will have a pleasant effect on our environment.",
        "To conclude, cheap air travel is mandatory for international holidays but the various factors linked to this outweigh its advantages.So authorities should take steps to counter such problems by taxation"
