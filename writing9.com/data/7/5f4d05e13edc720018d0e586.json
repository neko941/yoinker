        "Crime is any behaviour or an act that is punishable by the government. It includes not only violence, rape, or drugs, but also discrimination, road rage, burglary, and undeclared work. A popular stratum of society believes that crime is completely hypothetical and has always been present in our society is even in ancient times. However, in its stark contrast, other strongly of finds that crime can be completely eradicated on a combined effort by government and society. I would like to delve into both the arguments before forming an opinion.",
        "The first school of thought claims that crime has existed in human error since a long ago. Each and every person on this earth at least once in their life has either perform the criminal activity or faced crime as a victim. They are confident enough that these criminal activities will end only when there would no life exists on the earth. They also convinced that people to leave hope and live their life how it is, as their ancestors lived up the life in the same way. They truly believe that their governments would never take a stand against criminals, which is probably due to corruption. Most of the ministers are corrupt. In addition to which any criminal by offering some money may get bail from jail. For instance, a criminal by making robberies or working as a drug Pedler makes merits of money, and offering a little amount to Minister's awesome policemen may get help from them to be out of jail.",
        "However, in its sharp contrast, others have a strong belief that one day with the help of government they may be successful in eradicating crime from their society. They always believe that their government would have them whenever possible. They want to have a crime-free world that would always bring peace and create a lively environment around The world. They have different acts as well as ideas to perform with the criminals with the help of government so as to make a sensation of terror in the minds of people. In addition to which other people do not even think to do a criminal act. For example, they should be publicly executed by the army officials were they should be sentenced to life in prison, mint or they should be handed over to the public and make them to do whatever they want.",
        "In the end, I would like to conclude that the government should take steps accordingly to get rid of the crime and the criminals as they both are increasing day by day."
