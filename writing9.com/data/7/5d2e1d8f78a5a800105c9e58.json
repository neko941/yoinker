        "It is believed by most companies that workers ought to be corporately dressed, whereas some others agree that the quality of work is more important than dressing smartly. In my opinion, I completely agree to the fact that an employee's work outcome should be the focus instead of the way they dress. This essay will explain both sides of the argument.",
        "On the one hand, most business owners pay more attention to how their work force dresses because they believe that a man's appearance matters most in business. Also, it is the first thing a potential client sees and this can either motivate or discourage them from transacting with such individual. For example, bankers in Nigeria are well known for wearing corporate clothing and this has earned them a lot of respect and enhanced their acceptability by both their customers and the society as a whole. Casually dressed bankers are not recognised especially when they go out for marketing purposes. In essence, putting on smart clothing is essential for smooth running of business.",
        "On the other hand,the quality of work rather than corporate uniform is of more importance to some employers due to the fact the a person's ability or knnowledge  can not be judged by the cloth they wear. Someone can be so formal in their outfit and have zero skill or required knowledge. In addition, formal outfits can be uncomfortable and in order to allow workers to be at ease while working, these companies, therefore, give their employees the opportunity to put on whatever they want. For instance,  my husband, who graduated as a first class student from the university turned down a job offer because one of their requirements is to be clothed in a corporate uniform. This company, in my opinion, lost a valuable potential employee simply because of a flimsy criteria.",
        "In conclusion, an individual's work capacity should be the main focus of organizations rather than their uniforms."
