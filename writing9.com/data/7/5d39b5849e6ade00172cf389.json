If we create a lot of restrictions on animals like imprisoning them in tight spaces, they would not be able to have bracing air and pursue other animals. For the reason, the circumstance of keeping creatures is vital for living them. Consequently, living animals in natural dweller must be a major program for carrying them in run the world, to give them the chance of exposure usual being.",
        "Secondly, some animals are becoming extinct, that's why saving them is very crucial. Even though governments are spending huge budget for keeping them, the revenues will offset all costs. To be specific, take a kind of Chinese bear famous as a panda, a wide range of people travels to China to see these animals in zoos or circuses every year. Notwithstanding; most citizens decline the investment of governments for caring animals and find it as futile.
