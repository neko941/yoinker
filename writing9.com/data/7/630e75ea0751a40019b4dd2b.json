It is only enough for the bed and the desk, but there is no place to fit a chair that I need to use for studying. According to the photos on the university website, rooms are supposed to be at least as large as twelve square meters, providing enough space for multiple elements of furniture. The room that I was given looks different from what was portrayed on the pictures.",
