        "Although some individuals support the idea that companies should substitute elderly employees with young specialists as this step might help to reduce payroll cost, I belong to others, because older employees are more experienced. Also I can not stand with a retired social package as a monthly payment significantly decreases each year.",
        "To begin, the majority of older employees have more years of work experience. With this in mind, they are more qualified as well as skilful and can perform more duties rather than university graduates. Taking an example from Google corporation investigation when they had hired interns their productivity gradually decreased along with the deadline time slightly broken. The press manager of Google said that they would definitely try the same research in the near future to make sure the result was not corrupted by distracting factors. Situations like this are not uncommon, which is why the concept that young employees could save company capitalization is not considered for long-term.",
        "In addition to this, in my country retired people do not have fair social protection such as pension. Nowadays, we could observe a downward trend with retail policy. Previous decade professionals who have been working over twenty years might have retired after fifty years old and got about two minimum salaries per month as a retirement benefit, whereas now, retired age has been increased and pension decreased. Personally, I find it not fair enough as a large part of retired people feel their merits were not appreciated by the government, despite pension and it is hard for them to live in such an expensive world.",
        "To conclude from the aforementioned arguments, I firmly believe that companies should not persuade employees who are of retirement age to retire, moreover I feel like they need to elaborate on cooperating with university graduates and bring together experience from mature employees and ambition of immature employees."
