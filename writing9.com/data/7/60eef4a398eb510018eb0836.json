        "The job markets all over the world have been evolving for the last few decades, as a result of the introduction of various technologies which took away many jobs. Consequently, candidates are compelled to decide, whether they should seek employments they would dream of, or they should stick to a secure permanent job, even if they do not like it. In my personal view, there should be balance in job-seekers mind.",
        "People, who are in favour of finding joy in their careers believe that our mental health is the most important element to enjoy a prosperous life. People grow up with different dreams and ideas which they want to implement in their life and looking for a placement that meets this criterion is a gratifying experience. A study, conducted at the University of Toronto found out, the population live longer when they involve themselves in dream employment they imagined.",
        "On the flip side, it is not always possible to find a secured job in all the cities around the world. Cities and towns around the world have been shaped based on the purpose they may serve to the local communities. For this reason, the public argues that they have to relocate to get a prospective offer. Moreover, they have to leave their family members behind, which is not a pleasant experience. It has been found out in studies, that individuals who live alone suffer from depression more than others.",
        "On balance, I think that there should be a balance on expectation and possibility of achievements in minds of youngsters who started to run for jobs. To build a society that is innovative and happy as a whole, one needs to consider both aspects with the help of governments and corporations around them."
