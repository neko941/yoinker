        "These days many people struggle to eat healthy food consistently.  A primary cause of this trend is the availability of cheap and quick dining options for people who don\u2019t make time to prepare healthy food at home.  For these people, the solution involves allocating more time for grocery shopping and cooking.",
        "Many people have a poor diet because they don\u2019t set aside the required time to eat healthier options. Without question, balancing work, school, family, and social activities can be very challenging. One way people deal with competing obligations is to cut corners whenever possible, but especially when it comes to food.  Fast food and packaged microwaveable food are both easy to find and relatively inexpensive.  Unfortunately, they also tend to be less healthy than foods cooked at home with fresh ingredients.  Nevertheless, in order to save time, many people are willing to consume these unhealthy foods.",
        "The only real solution to this problem is to set aside more time to shop for healthy food and prepare it at home.  For some people, this may seem impossible.  A working parent, for example, probably does not want to spend precious hours in the kitchen cooking when that time could be spent with the kids. With just a little bit of online research, however, this parent could find many healthy recipes that do not take a long time to prepare.  For example, a simple pasta or rice dish with vegetables can be ready in 20-30 minutes, offering much more nutritional value than a hamburger and french fries.  Alternatively, some people set aside time on the weekends to cook large batches of food that can be reheated during the week.  With advanced planning like this, it should be possible to replace at least some unhealthy meals with home-cooked options on a regular basis.",
        "To conclude, even though time is extremely limited for many people today, it is important to resist the temptation to take shortcuts in the kitchen.  Healthy eating may require effort and planning, but prioritizing healthy eating is necessary to maintain good health."
