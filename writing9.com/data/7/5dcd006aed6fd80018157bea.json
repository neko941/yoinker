        "In recent times, more and more local residents have  moved to big cities to fetch   a better financial gain. Mainly this happens because of unemployment and to have a  better life; however, this causes many problems for  those who relocate there.",
        "The primary reason for dwelling to urban regions  by rural residents  is because of unemployment. In other words, due to  the lack of financial means to support family, since  there is less development programmes in remote places,  those who live these places cannot find employment opportunities to meet the requirements of family's demands. Eventually,  they tend to relocate to any cities in order to have a better life, but they may not be received  a welcoming approach there. In cities, there is a  huge competition among job seekers; therefore, the  only talented  can be selected. Thus,  city dwellers often find get a  work that they want to get.",
        "Another point  takes into consideration here is that,  most of the  villages have not  a sufficient number of public infrastructures to meet needs of the  villagers. This means, cities are well organised and built to meet  the requirements of the public: hospitals, schools, and transportation facilities.Having  better, advanced,  developments,  people from rural  regions are attracted. The life in the big cities require  a lot of money, even though salaries are  higher than other areas,  the expenses  also proportionally higher here. Take daily living costs, for instance,  house rent, water bill, travelling charges  are huge when it compared with local places.",
        "In conclusion,  moving to urban regions seems to be  a great decision, according to some, but that may not be true in most of the situations. It is predicted that   the villages be  advanced to meet at least the  basic requirements of the residents."
