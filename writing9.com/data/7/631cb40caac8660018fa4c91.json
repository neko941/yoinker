        "Nowadays, distractive emotions such as outrage and anger are common in society and for that reason, they affect negatively  the community. In this essay, I will explain why the case is so and also explain why I think that this is a negative development in the community. I will explain my reasons for it in the following paragraphs.",
        "There are many reasons why more and more anger and outrage are common in the public. First and foremost, due to negative attitudes more and more people easily fall into anger and negative emotion. To illustrate this, those people who are  wealthy  force  poor individuals and as a result, conflicts and violence create between them in terms of anger. Secondly, unemployment along with financial difficulties is  another cause of these distractive emotions. For example, due to the enormous population individuals do not find a job to manage their household budget and for that reason, they fall in anger. Also, a hectic lifestyle is a big contributing factor to these bad emotions.",
        "These aggression issues, in my opinion, this is a negative development. Firstly, it affects negatively  the community. To illustrate this, the public lost their temper and involve in bad crimes. For example, due to outrage and anger, people sometimes engage in crimes and lost their life. Secondly, due to this, employers create a negative environment in the office and as a result, the production of a particular company is reduced drastically. Furthermore, due to increase in outrage and distractive emotions destroy the growth of a particular country significantly due to aggressive people in the community.",
        "To conclude,  negative attitudes and unemployment along with financial difficulties are contributing factors to increasing  distractive emotions. Therefore, I think that it is a negative development, this is because it affects negatively society and the public creates a bad environment in the workplace."
