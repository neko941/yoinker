        "Trade and commerce play an important role in economic development. Big companies allocate a massive amount for selling and distribution of their new product, whereas, individuals are tempted for purchasing this item. In the market items produce by the other manufacturing entities will be unsold and in order promote product people must be offered a sample.",
        "Due to the large manufacturer exists in the society, small industries are suffering as their products are not being purchased by the people. The demand created by marketing by the multinational companies is forcing citizens to purchase their product only and the other tiny traders are not able to survive in the market as their item is not in demand and it is not being sold. For instance, In India, LG electronics are selling their items all the provinces. But the Geepas Ltd. Local brand are not able to sell as they are not able to afford additional cost of marketing.",
        "Furthermore, products produced by the native industries can be promoted only by explaining the people about the items. Offering the public free samples to use it and also to check the durability. Local people have already been lured to buy expensive items of Big companies and they will surely not buy the local produce item. So the people can test the free product at home and after knowing the power of the item. People will understand the real value of local product and also the price. Next time when they need to purchase public will opt for the native item because of the reliability and also the price. For instance, Geepas Ltd produces home appliance which is 35%cheaper compared to the LG electronic as the addition amount of marketing is added to price to recover from the customer.",
        "In conclusion, Local products are not being purchased by people because Large organisation are spending astronomical fund on promoting and selling the item. People can be informed about this product by offering them samples,"
