        "Change is the spice of life and in every age, we can notice so many changes. In yester years, every problem solves international boundary. Whereas, nowadays most of nations are joining two international corporation for solving urgent problems. It has been put forward that some urgent problems in modern society can only be solved with an international corporation company. I agree with this statement.",
        "The major reason that supports the urgent problem can only be solved with international cooperation is the stop spread of communicable diseases. For instance, there are a number of\u00a0 diseases spreading all over the world. With an international corporation to do strict action, then these diseases can be controlled in the whole world. Besides this, second reason is the environmental problems. A good illustration of that is environmental problems have no boundary to be restricted which are supplied with the help of water and air. If an international corporation takes some actions, then these problems can be overcome in the nation.",
        "However, other commentator opine that some problems can be solved with National corporation. The notable justification put forward is every journey of a thousand miles start with a single step. Similarly, every individual to take care of their health as well as environmental then it helps to overcome problem from the nation. Secondly, developing Nations have a lack of the financial resources, then these nations are fully dependent up aid of the international corporation to solve problem. It helps to increase the burden on the\u00a0 developed nation.",
        "To sum up, the above mentioned argument in a nutshell. It can be concluded that international corporation can solve our problems, but these problems overpowered with the collaboration of everyone."
