        "It is being considered that to get into university for any student is not so easy regardless of one\u2019s financial status. I agree that to get admission in university has some requirements that one should fulfil to get in, even if someone is ready to pay any amount. Also, many students who get admission but cannot afford the tuition fees can get a scholarship by covering its own requirements.",
        "Firstly, in order to have admission in any university, it requires you to go through each of the need which a particular university is looking for. For instance, some universities ask students to have a very good academic record and other questions about to get passed in some standard tests. In addition, some universities also ask for the nationality, as if that falls in the acceptable list of countries. So, whether poor or rich one should overcome all the needs of any university.",
        "On the other hand, if a poor student is looking for admission in university and he/she completes every aspect of the admission committee what they are looking for, then he/she will surely get admission. Again, if that student cannot afford to pay the sum of money, then he or she can apply for the scholarships, many academic institutes offer various scholarships, but each of them has its own requirements, those again need to be covered in order to grab that opportunity.",
        "To conclude, the student who seeks admission in any university does not require to have a good financial background, all he or she must do is, complete the requirements of the institute, furthermore if anyone suffers to pay, then there are funding\u2019s available in various universities."
