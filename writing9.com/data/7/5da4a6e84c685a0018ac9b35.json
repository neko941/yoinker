        "In Many continents and regions people are staying in a use and throw society, in which different things are being used for a short time and throwing away. This essay will discuss the root causes, including Lack of time, availability of Use and throw products   and problems associated with it such as damage to then environment and cost incurred on customers.",
        "It has become mandatory for both wife and husband to work to meet the growing needs of luxurious life. Due to which, people are not getting enough time to prepare or do  anything which takes relatively high time. More and more firms are manufacturing goods and food items which come with short durability and less costly.  For instance, In my family we are more inclined towards buying used and throw items which are widely available in the market  because myself and my wife are leading a  very busy life.",
        "",
        "There are several serious problems with this recent trend.  Firstly, Short time usage products can cause severe problems to the environment, because it is obvious that such things are made  with low quality  raw materials. For instance, use and throw plastic toys are made with degraded quality plastic, which will have a severe dent on global ecosystem.",
        "Also, with use and throw approach people spend   money recursively to busy same item again and again. Since durability of such products is very short, there would be no option to customer other than buying them again. For instance, I spend lots of money everything on use and throw plastic bags.",
        "To conclude, \"Use and throw away\" approach has several problems such as environmental issues, expenditure of customer and root causes for such problems are unavailability of time and accessibility to such products."
