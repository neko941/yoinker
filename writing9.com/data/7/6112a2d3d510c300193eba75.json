        "Nowadays, because of the rise of technology, the world wide web offers a lot of courses. It is often thought by many that learning through the internet has more benefits than in traditional classroom settings. However, some would think otherwise. In this essay, I will be discussing both advantages and disadvantages before giving my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, courses offered through the internet are advantageous because students can learn not only in the comfort but also the safety of their own homes. They would not need much effort to prepare for the day and physically go to the classrooms. For example, with the current situation, universities are forced to conduct courses online. Because of this, the risk of contracting the virus is decreased.",
        "On the other hand, doing these would pose certain downsides not only for the teachers but also for learners. The former might lose their jobs because through online classes, less manpower is needed. The latter would find it difficult to separate the learning setting from the comfort of their own homes. A secondary school student, for instance, might not associate his or her home with family because he or she answers quizzes in the common room. Consequently, this would destroy the importance of family bonding.",
        "In summary, people believe that courses taught through the internet has more positive impact than usual teaching, while others say that these has more adverse effects. A major advantage is that students would be safer in their respective homes. Although, a disadvantage would be that lecturers might not be able to teach. In my opinion, the conventional curriculum should not be replaced by internet courses because it is not only appropriate but also ethical to distinguish the different social aspects of life."
