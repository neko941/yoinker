        "In some countries, parents incentivize children by telling them that they could reach any dream if their striving is hard enough. However, I believe is it a two-sided phenomenon, which is outlined below.",
        "It seems common that many parents have the outdated mindset that they would chase anything to respond to their children\u2019s requests. To be honest, this way solely lets a child be spoilt. As an adult, we absolutely understand life will not always have a completely clear answer to our cravings, even for good or bad purposes. Besides that, leaving the young adult to try their best without any responsibilities to tackle the unexpected results might be a contributor to their failure afterward. The state of letting ourselves accomplish the child\u2019s desire will form unfortunate characteristics including arrogance or irresponsibility for our children.",
        "As for a child brought up without being taught about adaption as well as experiences to deal with a diverse society, a right time compliment will always be a helpful remedy. Precisely, the message of trying hard to reach their targets, which is used in the right circumstance applying to a realistic aim, will be a fierce motivation for any child. It is advisable that give children suggestions to improve what they missed and compliments to cherish what they gained. What a motivating message could do is to form an ambitious, good vision and responsible person.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, one can see that since life is not the bed of roses, parents whose children are typically innocent and easily spoilt must have an ability to understand the right way to bring them up and clearly distinguish which is suitable from which is not."
