        "Conversely, daily activities are similar to aerobic exercise such as walking or climbing stairs which is beneficial to strengthen the cardiopulmonary function as well as it is costless and easy to get started. By example, getting off the bus before two stops of the home or workplace in order to have a short walk, which is great for working out.

Accordingly, I approve with the statement says that everyday activities is abundant for people to stay fit."
