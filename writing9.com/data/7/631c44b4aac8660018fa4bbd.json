        "It is often argued that a large number of people engaged in bad activities even though they know the effects of these activities on their health. In this essay, I will explain why the case is so and also gives some possible suggestions to eliminate this problem very effectively.",
        "To begin with, there are many reasons why individuals are engaged in bad habits irrespective of knowing the effects of these on their health. First and foremost, some people are prone to unhealthy activities and for that reason, they are involved in bad habits. For example, smoking  cigarette is dangerous for health but the public still smokes this item on an everyday basis and do not stop smoking due to a lack of willpower and facing health problems like lung cancer and tuberculosis. Also, few individuals underestimate the effect of particular bad habits. To illustrate this, drinking alcohol is harmful to people's health but even though they drink it unlimitedly and lose their life.",
        "These solutions are not simple but they do exist. Firstly, the government should campaign in public places and over the internet about these unhealthy activities and disadvantages which help the community to prevent  these bad activities. For example, Nigeria, one of the countries in Africa has the least smokers below 5%, this is because the free government campaigns help the public to remove their smoking habits. Furthermore, quick access from a medical professional can help the public who are suffering from these problems by giving positive quotes and helps, It will impact positively on them.",
        "To conclude, due to underestimating the effect of unhealthy activities  and being prone to these, people are more engaged in unhealthy activities. Therefore, with the help of  government campaigns and medical professionals' assistance impact is positive on people to remove their bad habits."
