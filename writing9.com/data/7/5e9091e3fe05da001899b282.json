        "In this contemporary era, the world is changing by leaps and bounds. Nowadays, each and every industry shifting their interests towards integration and automation. So, they require more multi talented employees who are able to do any tasks. So, some people believe that working for the same organization for whole life is quite easy, whereas the others argue that it is better to work for different organizations. I totally agree with the latter view. It has more pros outweigh cons.",
        "First and foremost, the major advantage of work for different organizations is employee has more experience of different workplaces. Also, industries are always looking for the flexible employee who can able to do more than a task. These people are not only able to tackle any problems, but also they have vast knowledge about different fields of work. Due to this, they always dedicated to their work.",
        "In addition to the above, they have a lot of exposure. Companies do not hire the other workers because of their multi talent. These people can set in any working environment, which is the most prior advantage. Moreover, they have diverse personalities and know how to use them. For example, if they talk with the manager, then they will give only a few suggestions, because they know the manager will understand their tale, whereas when if they talk with the labours, then they will explain everything.",
        "On the other hand, many people think that working for the same organization over life can give more benefits. Firstly, they are able to secure their jobs. So, they will develop their career in only a field, but they can excel in that field and no one can match their efficiency. Owing to this, they get promotions on their skills and seniorities as well. Furthermore, they are seniors so, they are being respected by their co-workers. Also, when they give advice none of another can rebuff their suggestions.",
        "To conclude, advantages of working for different organizations are more. Also, workers can learn new things in their lives so, they do not feel work as a burden, so they work with full enthusiasm,"
