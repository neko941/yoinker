Hence arts are considered important as they play a unique role in our lives today",
        "Knowledge is power. Additionally, activities such as drama, melody, and museum visits should be added to the school curriculum as it will help to broaden the knowledge of school children. To elucidate further, making art part of the institution activity will help students to discover their talent and other skills that are different from the common subjects such as English and math amongst others. For example, going on excursions to museums as part of the school program is important, due to the fact that it exposes students to wildlife and its importance. Therefore, teachers should ensure that subjects such as music, theatre, and artwork are part of the academic function, as it helps to boost the intellectual capacity of school children.",
        "In conclusion, arts such as play, songs and drawing and considered essential nowadays and should be culminated as part of the academic program."
