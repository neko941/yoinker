        "My name is Carola. I have seen your advertisement in a magazine and I'm writing to you because I would like to be considered for the position you are offering. I really would like to work for you because I think it will be a good experience for you and me. I like to travel, know about different cultures and meet new people. I have never been to Australia but I'm pretty sure there a lot of things to see and try. I have previous experience looking after children. Currently I'm working for an Irish family and I take care of ofr children whose ages vary from three to eight. I have to say that I've never thought looking after children would be that rewarding. I enjoy spending time with them and I have learnt a lot. I'm really patient, tidy, reliable and hard working.",
