        "Dear Sir or Madam",
        "I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the municipal corporation\u2019s decision to demolish the old Hillock Fort in the Mumbai region. I have been living in this place since my childhood and that probably explains why I have developed an emotional attachment to this city and its monuments.",
        "I admit that the fort is in a very bad condition at the moment, but it is not beyond repair. In fact, it can be restored with some effort. Of course, that would mean spending some money, but once it gets restored the fort can be used to benefit the community. For example, it can be used to house a historical museum or a library. Because of its dilapidated condition, the structure doesn\u2019t attract many visitors at the moment, but it has the potential to be a tourist attraction if it is restored.",
        "I understand that the proposed shopping center will bring some commercial activity into the area, but I do not think that it should be done at the expense of one of the most interesting landmarks of Mumbai.",
        "I hope the municipal corporation reconsiders its decision and find another site for building the shopping center.",
