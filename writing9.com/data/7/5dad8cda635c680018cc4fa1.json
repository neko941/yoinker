        "While some believe that team sports is essential in determining the success of a child's career, others feel this is not true. This essay will discuss both opinions and my thoughts will be provided at the end.",
        "Team sports teach children how to work with other people, which is a useful skill for many careers. Team sports show children how they need to work together in order to succeed. Many lines of work require cooperating with one another in order to achieve a common goal. For example, many companies have yearly team-building activities to improve the work of their staff. Therefore, team sports are useful in teaching how working together leads to success.",
        "In contrast, individual sports teach children how to not be reliant on others. By not depending on other people, self motivation and a competitive streak is encouraged which are both important skills to advance in a career. Those involved in team sports, for example cricket, are less motivated to pull their weight because their team members can pick them up if they fail. Additionally, people who play individual sports have shown to have better work ethic which results in more promotions. For this reason, individual sports promote independence, and in turn, success.",
        "In conclusion, while team sports teach children how to interact with others, individual sports are more beneficial as it shows how to not be dependent on others which is better in career-wise. Therefore, in my opinion, team sports are not as useful for career success compared to individual sports."
