        "Dear James,",
        "I hope this letter finds you in sheer good health. After mulling over on your business proposal for a significant amount of time, I decided to revert you regarding it. As, you told me that you are planning to establish a Multi-speciality Hospital in Noida of hundred beds which will be embellished with all modern facilities such as C.T and M.R.I machines and that you want to make me a partner in this project.",
        "Firstly, I firmly believe, it is an excellent notion for the upliftment of your career however, considering all the facts, I concluded that it will not be appropriate for me because unlike you, I do not have immense funds to contribute equally in this project. In addition, I have no business sense in fact, no one in my entire family has been into this occupation. Most of my family members are either Engineers or Doctors just like me and to be a successful businessman, it is mandatory to have sufficient knowledge and experience.",
        "Though, it is not only a tempting offer but indeed a dream of every Doctor to own a Hospital nonetheless, I have to state woefully that I do not find myself suitable for this responsibility. Although, you have huge expectations from me but I am certain that you will try to comprehend my difficulty. I hope, my decision will have no adverse effect on our robust friendship.",
        "I express deepest apology for this matter.",
