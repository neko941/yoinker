        "I hope you are fit and fine. I can't wait to spill the beans about the biggest public event of the year which is the Commonwealth games 2022 and our country is hosting the event in my hometown.",
        "Well, as I don't want to enjoy the event without you, I invite you to be here on 23rd to 28th next month so book your flight from Brisbane to Alberta without any delay. Because it was our dream to be a spectator of the Commonwealth games, finally our dream comes true. I assure you would love the arrangements that our local administration is doing in order to make the event successful as well as enjoyable.  In addition, the stadiums would be in the shape of bird nests and I believe it would be a great moment to capture the event for your blog.",
        "Further, I am so glad to tell you that I have planned a number of activities for both of us. Primarily, my friend Ron is in managing team so I have fixed first row tickets of our favourite sports along with a chance to take selfies with famous athletes. Moreover, I have selected a picnic spot near to this event site where we would enjoy barbeque.",
