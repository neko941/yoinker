        "It is argued that several people tend to send their children to  educational institutions at five years old, while others do not start studying until they are seven. Nevertheless,  compulsory education begins in different countries at different age as well as it depends on the development of the notion.",
        "It is clear that the younger the child is the better he acquires knowledge. Many people believe, that children can easily learn a new language and memorise new information due to the educational and intellectual games. Another benefit of early education is that child has an opportunity to be more social along with being more independent from the parents. For example, Bella - a 9-year-old girl, speaks 7 languages without misunderstanding and problems. Her parents engaged the private teachers, who taught her, while she just was playing. This is an excellent example that children will have the ability to learn something faster if they are young.",
        "However, one of the most significant drawback in sending children to school at 7 or 8 that a lot of programmes lasts 12 years. As a result,people are going to graduate at 19 or 20.  Nonetheless, at that age ,they might define better the profession that is interested in. For instance, at South Korea, the students complete their higher school education at 20 but it does not interrupt the university education as well as life on the whole.",
        "From what has been discussed above here should be drawn a conclusion that it is better to begin  formal education at 6 because there are more opportunities to acquire more knowledge during the game."
