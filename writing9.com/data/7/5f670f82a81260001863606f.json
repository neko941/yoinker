        "It is argued that society should not take measures in order to curb the degradation of the environment and instead need to accept the situation. Having accumulated a variety of solutions to tackle climate change, speaking personally, I advocate this statement because we still do not get any significant results, and it is a total waste of global budget.",
        "To commence, although numerous implementations in decreasing levels of emissions, that contribute to climate change, were made, global society witnesses no critical drop in them. Thus, these ecological decisions may be onsidered as inaccurate money expenses, and therefore could be spent in more beneficial ways. To exemplify, wind electricity plants that have been erected in suburbs of the capital of Kazakhstan required roughly 500 million dollars that set  confusion among residents. It has been claimed that this national money could be spent on subsidizing less advantageous spheres such as farming and oil industry.",
        "Despite the aforementioned argument, it is claimed that if we will find a way to live with the current climate change, people would be less stressed. In the present, increasingly more incidents about people's occurring depression about global depletion of the environment. Society would be more mentally stable if they accept the fact of it.  For example, if an individual is afraid of how he could prevent environmental issue, he will be more stress inclined; however, it will be easier to live if he will just live with it.",
        "To conclude, I agree that we should ignore the global temperature change because most of the solutions to prevent the problem is costly, and it would be lighter stress burden on people."
