        "It was great to receive your letter and I am delighted to tell you my advice on what you should do in this  letter. As far as I am concerned, I think you should try to get a job.",
        "To begin with, although I know that you wanted to go to college, I believe that it will not be a good option for you since you have to support back to your family and you will have difficulties to meet both your courses fees and your family\u2019s basic need. Consequently, you will not have enough time to study and later on you will be boring to go to college.",
        "As per the above reasons and circumstances that you have, it is the best way for you to try to get a job. As you can make income to support your family and get work experience. Moreover, if you are still keen on learning then you can join some part-time courses that will not be expensive like full-time courses. Therefore, I suggest you to try to get a job and I think sale role is really suitable for you since you are conversationalist. I believe that customers will be persuaded by your communication skills.",
