        "In this contemporary epoch, whilst proponents hold the view that artificial intelligence has a profound impact on our professional and family lives , opponents have a diverse perspective. However, I am convinced that our constant use of machineries affects our society negatively . My contention will be further explained .",
        "On the one hand, despite agreeing that cutting-edge electronics have a detrimental impact on us , some advocates discern that they have a plethora of advantages , In other words, they save our time and money as well . For instance, dishwashers that have been found in many homes recently ,and many housewives do not waste their time washing the dishes . Consequently , that will not only save their time , but also give them many chances to do other pastime activities instead",
        "On the other hand, there is a public belief that robotics might control our lives in the future . To illustrate, many entrepreneurs will rely on them constantly to do traditional jobs ,and that will affect the workforce negatively . An eminent example is the packaging and delivering jobs that have been made by machines  in many factories . Thus, what can be said is that if we completely depend on artificial intelligence to do our work , that will negatively influence our intellectual development ,and will affect the proletariat compulsively.",
        "In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the points mentioned above , it can be reiterated that robotics` malignant effect surpasses the benign one . Hence , I believe that we should lessen our reliance on them ."
