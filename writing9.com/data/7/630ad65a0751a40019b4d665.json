        "All around the world there are more than 6,000 languages; however, a grand amount of languages are disappearing because they are spoken by fewer people. Many people opine that the government should invest public money in order to save these languages, while others claim that it is a waste of money. In the following essay I will take a look at both sides of the argument.",
        "First of all, many people believe in order to preserve a language the government should spend a bunch of money. This amount of money could help in hiring more interpreters or even more teachers, so they can teach  domestic students and international students. For example, in my country, Bolivia, schools are obligated to teach a native language like Aymara or Quechua, so the students can easily interact with native speakers of that kind. To sum up, for these people investing in money is an excellent way to save those languages.",
        "On the other hand, many individuals think that spending public capital so a language can still existing, it is a waste of money. For instance, they think that it is better to invest that money in hospitals, schools, or even food. Likewise, we are using this money on useful resources that can benefit the population. They really do not care if a language became extinct.",
        "Although this last argument sounds reasonable, in my opinion preserving a language  is a beautiful way of bringing tourists to the country. In addition, a language for many people  is very important in their environment and history, especially the elderly people, because they want  other' generations can be able to speak it."
