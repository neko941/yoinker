        "Digitalization has a great impact on human\u2019s life, sometimes it has a negative effect and sometimes it has a positive effect. However",
        ", some people believe media coverage of celebrities is putting a negative impression",
        "on kids. I do not agree with the statement at all, as it depends on the situation and the celebrity\u2019s personality, they are following.",
        "In young age, human learn and adapt things easily and very quickly, which is hard to change later.",
        "Firstly, celebrities have a great impression on our soul, but most of the time it is positive. They never want to show their negative or dark side of life to media and always hide it. For Example, Mr Salam Khan, a world-famous actor from Bollywood, he always donates his 90% of the income and always active in social works. Kids and others follow him and many have adapted this positivity.",
        "On the other hand, many kids do follow some celebrities and try to be like them. As matter of fact sometimes it has a negative impact. For instance, Mr Sanjay Dutt was drug-addicted and he never gives an explanation on the media and tries to control the media through his political influence, but he came up and explain it  when he was successful in quitting it. So, teenagers and young people should not adopt this habit and parents can keep an eye on their offspring. Unfortunately, some of the kids have that negative impact on life, but not the bright one.",
        "In the conclusion, media coverage of the various celebrities has  different impacts, but it cannot be concluded that only negative effect is affecting children, it can be positive as well."
