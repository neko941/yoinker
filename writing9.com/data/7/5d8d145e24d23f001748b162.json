        "Despite the benefits, there are some drawbacks associated with living in a care home. The main issue is that assisted living facilities can be very costly. Many people cannot afford to pay for constant care, especially if they do not have plenty of retirement savings. Another disadvantage is increased sense of isolation and loneliness. In many cases, living in nursing home leads to reducing contact with family and friends. To illustrate, people often put their elderly relatives in care homes that are situated a long distance from their homes. As a result, they meet each other less frequently. Overall, living in a senior house has many negative aspects to consider.",

This essay discussed the main advantages of care homes, including safety and social aspects. This essay also suggested risks associated with assisted living facilities, such as high costs and reducing contact with family."
