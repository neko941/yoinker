But while it may offer some advantages it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To What extent do you agree or disagree to this statement. Give reasons for your answer.",

        "Many people find going abroad is quite challenging, but it is said that there are advantages. But some say that it is better not to go overseas because it might be difficult to adapt to that culture.",
        "I partially agree that people should go abroad since I have experienced this in my life and I know how it feels like to go somewhere else than your own country.",
        "The reason why agree is that those can make a relationship between people from different countries, though there is a possibility of them experiencing hard time, the result will always be good. At the same time, people can learn about each individual culture and get to know how it is like to live in a different country. As in terms of study, there are more resources and chances of them learning what they really want and more knowledge provided by university lectures. Also it is one of the best ways to refresh since you can forget about things in your country and find something new about yourself.",
        "However, there are also demerits that people should be aware of. Your destination will not be your country, so you have to accept the fact that you can experience racism from locals; it is not always the same as you expect. And if that is your first time travelling abroad, you need to be aware of scams, which is usually targeted to foreigners and take advance of you not knowing the local price. Especially, if you go to the area where not many people are in, you should be careful with your belongings. So, it is not going to be a nice experience if you do not know how to take care of things.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that studying abroad will lead to open another gate of the future, but there are many things that those need to be aware of, to avoid any tragedies."
