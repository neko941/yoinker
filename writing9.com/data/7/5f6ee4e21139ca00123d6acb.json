        "Good parenting skills are something which has become very important and is considered to be given the utmost care and this is a very sensitive issue. I totally agree with the opinion that schools must teach young people to be a good parent. In the early years, good habits and a good way of living can be inculcated in the student which will be very useful in the long run. In this easy,I will talk about the skills to be a good parent.",
        "Firstly, to be a good parent, one must have a lot of patience. Parenting can become very tough if the mother or father loses patience on every mistake that the child does. They must try to understand the child phycology and why he or she behaves in a certain way. Simply shouting at them for all their mistakes will not help in improving their mindset. This can have a negative impact on the child's brain.",
        "Secondly, listening and understanding of what the child needs are very crucial, especially in their growing years. For example, when a child returns from school parents must spend time along with them to know about their day spent, what they did during art and craft class or about the sport they are pursuing ins school. Through this, they will understand the likes and dislikes of their children and they can channel these interest in the correct directions. These areas of interest could be tapped for developing themselves. Thus, instead of forcing them to take some hobby or interest, parent should encourage the o take up something that they enjoy.",
        "To conclude, parenting skills are such that they must be imbibed in people from a very young age. These attributes of people will help them in becoming good parents."
