        "The pace of change in the world of technology has modified our way of living in many different aspects. While some people state that these technologies allow us to see films in everywhere, through our phones, tablets, or laptops, without the needed to go to the cinema, others, including myself, believe that the full experience in a movie theatre cannot be replaced. The argument of each side will be discussed in this essay.",
        "Although the world has been growing and more people have access to, basically, everything from their cellphones or tablets, this fact is not true regarding some facilities. In fact, some small cities do not have a cinema, and the only way of watching movies is online, thanks to the advancements in technology. In addition, many might prefer to not to go to the cinema due to the commodity, as well as the large variety of movies, when watching them from home. Some statistics provided by well-known streams, such as Netflix, Globoplay, and Amazon prime pointed out an increasing on 45%, on average, in the number of users. Therefore, people still appreciate movies only the place of doing it has been slightly changed.",
        "There are many reasons why people still opt to go out and watch movies in the cinema, instead of doing it at home. The main reason is that in a cinema, you will be able to go with your friends and have a full experience of the movie, in terms of sound and visual technologies, when compared to watching it from home. And second, it is a way of entertainment and spending some leisure time, by, for example, going to a pre-released of a movie and watch it before others. Recently, the cinematographic world has experienced a new record in revenue funding with the new movie \u201cAvengers\u201d, in which the number of pre-released rooms was the biggest in history.",
        "To summarize, the technology has brought several developments and changes in the world, including our way of watching films. Some prefer to stay at home and watch when they want, without having to go out, while others, including myself, argue that a full experience of a movie in a cinema, with all the sounds, is the most enjoyable way of watching a movie."
