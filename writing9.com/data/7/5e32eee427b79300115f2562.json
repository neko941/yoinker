        "According to me, I don't think you will have fun if you go to college now. Firstly, there are going to be too many assignments, which you may have to prepare and long essays, that you may have to write which you just hate completely. Secondly, the age group of students that generally enrol for this course are way too young compared to your age. Therefore, you may not enjoy the company of the people around you.",
        "On the contrary, I feel that getting a job will be a much better option for you, because it will give you financial stability and it will help to improve your confidence level. Additionally, it will also give you a very good exposure to cooperate life that will boost up your resume drastically.",
        "As I know, you have an amazing quality of interpretation and you have received an award in your internship when you worked as an analyst in your previous company, I feel you should search for similar work, for example, the role of an analyst. I am sure will flourish well in that role.",
