        "It is a common belief that the attire of a person reflects a lot of information. Many people argue that a person\u2019s culture and character can be predicted by one\u2019s choice of clothes. I agree that clothes can implicate a person\u2019s culture, but I don\u2019t believe that character can be judged by the way people dress up.",
        "It is a well-known fact that people from different regions dress up differently, and the majority of these dresses are heavily influenced by the culture of that particular region. Many people prefer to follow a common dress code which is appreciated in their ethnicity or region. For example, Muslim women prefer to wear a veil to cover their heads and bodies. Furthermore, Pakistani women prefer to wear a particular style of shirt and a trouser which reflects the Pakistani culture. By looking at this unique way of dressing or covering the body, one can easily predict their culture and religion. Therefore, culture and the way people dress up are strongly interlinked.",
        "Character, however, is the moral and mental thinking of an individual which has no link with the way people dress up. Personal character is a completely distinctive quality. A group of people living in the same community and sharing the same patterns of clothing, culture, profession, and religion can have different types of characters. For example, in a country a criminal and a common man could be wearing the same dress while their actions and mentality could be completely different from each other. Therefore, it is hardly possible to predict one\u2019s character from the way a person dresses up.",
        "In conclusion, the culture of a person can indeed be predicted by looking at one\u2019s attire, but it\u2019s impossible to predict the character of a person just by the choice of clothes."
