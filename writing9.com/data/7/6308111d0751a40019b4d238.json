        "There has been a controversy about whether students should wear a uniform at school. Some people think children should be free to choose their own clothes; some have the opposite opinions. I think the advantages of wearing a uniform outweigh its disadvantages.",
        "First, giving students equal identities and positions. As we know, the clothes you wear can always reflect your financial situation; for example, wealthy people constantly wear designer goods. Therefore, if there was no uniform role at school, it's bound to cause some issues, such as a comparison between students in terms of the clothes their wear. Take me as an example. Students with wealthy parents consistently wear designer products, like Nike, in my old school. And they always mocked the unwealthy students' clothes. At this point, a uniform can prevent students from comparing their outfits with one another because everyone is wearing the same.",
        "Second, paying more attention to studies. It's expected that if students were allowed to dress whatever they want, it's highly possible that they will spend a considerable amount of time on it because they want to present the best themselves. On the contrary, students could concentrate more on their studies if there was a uniform restriction.",
        "On the other hand, there are some disadvantages of a uniform. First, students' individualism can be affected negatively to a large extent. It's commonplace that everyone is distinctive; hence, we have our own tastes in terms of clothing. However, the existence of a uniform forces students to wear the same cloth, which can ruin students' individualism.",
        "In conclusion, I believe the merits of wearing a uniform outstrip its demerits."
