        "Above all, some people deem that our societies have achieved gender equality, but generally males depreciate females and don\u2019t believe, that women can do the same work as men even better. In my opinion, the position of women changed to the best side, despite is frequently rules constrain mainly actions relevant to women.",
        "On the one hand, for comparing with over the past 50 years now females is having more opportunities along with the main factor  is accepting education for women. Becoming able to make your own decision is part of satisfactory growth. Besides, females started to show from their own experience, that they could be  boss in a global company, has many employees and be nevertheless successfully than men. For instance, Kim Kardashian who has a business with a turnover of millions of dollars and she don\u2019t need to prove to anyone that she can do it all at the same level as men significantly better in spite of some male who can\u2019t accept this success without doubt about the path of achievements.",
        "On the other hand, the main problem was and will always gender inequality if females will begin to rule this world, males will take it lightly and trust, that women can only sit at home and take care of children. Furthermore, men permit to do cruel actions to women and consider, that they have permission for this. For this reason, repeatedly women are forced to struggle with injustice from generally accepted norms.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that in the future societies acknowledge how dangerous and general this problem is, but although now some organizations for protection rules of women have a suitable reputation and people who want to live in an equal world where everyone has the same rules. Only in a way where all people will apprehend real issues world can have a satisfactory time ahead."
