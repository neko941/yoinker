Other think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course  is useful to an employer.\n\n\nWhat is your opinion, should be the main function of a university?",

        "So, according to the opinions of some individual teaching institutes need to teach the actual work that a graduate is supposed to do in his job after graduating, on the contrary other thinks that institutes need to give information according to the curriculum which they think is best irrespective of whether it can be useful or not in the work after study.",
        "Firstly I will talk about the importance of providing main information, because ninety percent of individuals do graduations for the purpose of doing work in a company or self business, so it is of utmost importance to give information which will be helpful to the students after passing out. For example, nowadays there have been a compulsory one semester of industrial training provided to ensure that students get exposure required, consequently which will help them in understanding and adjusting better with that culture.",
        "On the other hand, if we talk about going with curriculum, and if they are not sure whether it will help or not after completing their studies, then it's a paradoxical situation for the schooling institute I believe.For instance, a graduate student went on to give an interview, but he has no clue of what a potential employer is asking because he has not learnt any relevant thing from his study hence his time of degree goes in vain in the actual sense.",
        "So to conclude, I will restate that all teaching places should focus on their applications of the curriculum rather than going with already running traditional system, which doesn't care about its use. Because it will be the main crux of the whole studying, and then only it will be of some use to the student."
