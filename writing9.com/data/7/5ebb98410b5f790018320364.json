        "Celebrities are an important part of the civilization today.Some people are of the viewpoint that these people are paid large sums of money and affect the community negatively, while others are of diverse view. In my opinion, entertainers have a good impact on the community. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and provide my point of view.",
        "The part of the population that believes superstars have a detrimental effect on the country are of the view that young people watch these influences on television and social media and may adopt the wrong habits portrayed by them in films and shows. For instance, the youth and teenagers may start drinking, smoking or gambling after watching their ideals do so. Secondly,a lot of people copy celebrities, these days in hopes of getting richer and becoming famous, which in turn can lead to lack in self esteem and dissatisfaction with one's life. Since, the above consequences can hamper the progress of the humankind and affect the community  in a negative way, paying them a lot of money is logically incorrect in these people's minds.",
        "On the other hand, actors, dancers, athletes and other famous people contribute positively to the country in several ways. Firstly, many of these entertainers inspire people to work hard, follow their dreams and achieve their goals. For instance, 90% of the fresh athletes entering the national teams today were inspired by some famous sports person in their childhood. Furthermore, these famous entertainers teach people to be open minded as well as to accept new ideas,through their actions and work. There are several movies or incidents in history involving these famed people that have inspired a change in the culture.Provided that, celebrities deserve high remuneration for making the world a better place.",
        "To conclude, celebrities have more positive impacts on the world than negative ones. In my viewpoint, the entertainers deserve the wages they earn due  to their hard work and for the part they play in making our population more tolerant towards new innovations and ideas."
