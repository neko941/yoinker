        "Some argue that free time should be used for mentally demanding activities as reading or solving crosswords while others claim that it ought to be utilised to let the mind rest. I strongly believe that it is essential to perform different types of activities during the leisure time than those necessary while working.",
        "Supporters of exercising the mind as a leisure activity highlight the benefit of healthier brain in the long term. Without a doubt, the pastimes involving mental effort strenghten memory in addition to broadening one\u2019s knowledge. Moreover, the research suggests that those who spend at least half an hour a day reading or playing mind games are four times less likely to develop neurodegenerative diseases, for example, dementia, compared to those who do not engage in these activities at all. Therefore, certainly, it might be extremely beneficial for blue-collar workers.",
        "On the other hand, many believe that the mind has to rest during free time. It seems that the majority of white-collar workers prefer playing sports after work rather than anything which puts strain on their minds. After running or swimming many of them feel relaxed. This subjective feeling is supported by research evidence showing that not only mental but also an appropriate amount of physical exercise is crucial for the health of our brains. Hence, those in jobs requiring high mental effort, for instance, doctors, lawers or scientist are adviced to spend their leisure time performing physical workout.",
        "In conclusion, both kinds of recreational activities those exercising mind as well as those which let it rest have an important place in peoples lives. In my opinion, which is also supported by scientific research, which type of leisure activity is vital for an individual depends on the nature of the person\u2019s occupation."

    "submitter": "With the recent increase in migrati, the believe that the countries hosting mixed natiality populatis are not ly more intriguing but also develop faster is gaining support. Although I firmly agree with the latter, in my opini the opposite is true about the former.  In multinatial countries the diversity of cultures is disappearing. In other words, when moving to live in a foreing country, many adapt to the way of living in their new country while not cultivating their own traditis anymore. For instance, the majority of migrants from Africa changed the way they dress when they had arrived in Italy. Furthermore, some native residents take foreign traditis as their own, such as celebrating Diwali (a Hindu holiday) in some part of the UK. Therefore, despite the popural believe, multinatial society does not make the country more interesting as the cultural diversity dies out in the lg term.  Ccerning the pace of development of those countries,  the other hand, this type of the society increases it significantly. This is due to the fact that ccentrating experts in a particular topic, who are coming from a plethora of different natis, allows to share their various experiences and knowledge to achieve the comm goal much faster. Taking the United States as an example, in every public instituti, including universities, it is possible to meet individuals from every country in the world, which resulted in the fact that the US became the fastest developing country in terms of technology.  To cclude, countries which are home to the variety of natialities are not necessary more interesting than those inhabited by a single nati. However, certainly, a wide range of experiences brought by members of various cultures might ctribute to faster developments of those countries.",
