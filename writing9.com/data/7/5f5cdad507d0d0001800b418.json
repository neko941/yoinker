        "Nowadays pupils believe that the growing nations require economical backing from multinational institutions to pursue their development. On the contrary, some population  find it beneficial if a region receives non-financial help. This essay will discuss the benefits of receiving monetary backing and physical suggestions.",
        "With the drastic improvement and growth in the infrastructure, it is influencing the leaders of the countries to improve their system for better functioning. Moreover, it inclines the decision-makers to approach powerful firms with their requests. Since  everything is becoming digitalised and firms are expanding their businesses aborad which has shown results of international trades. These firms are providing financial backing on credit to develop these places. This often causes trouble and hostility among the countries if one party is not able to keep their promise. For instance, India has incurred itself in huge foreign investments but has failed to show results.",
        "Another school of thought says that suggestions and advice from experts are more preferable and beneficial than financial help. Nowadays, people spend on knowledge and expert's advise for better result and decision making. To give an example, India has been receiving intelligence advice from Israel and USA and is offering tax reductions and duty elimination on their trades with the country.",
        "It is rightly said that money is most crucial for a nation to develop themselves, however, countries rely on expert's advice and educated human beings. After discussing both cases, in my opinion, it is essential for a nation to receive financial backing from international companies."
