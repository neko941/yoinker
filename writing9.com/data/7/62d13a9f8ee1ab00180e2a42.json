        "Purchasing a house, no matter it is new or old, is such a huge expense in human life. Some people think the goal of their life is to own a house so that they do not need to spend money on renting a room or apartment. As far as I am concerned, I disagree with this concept and I think it is a negative phenomenon in our society.",
        "There are some differences in how  people enjoy their life. Although finding a place to live is quite necessary for human life,  renting a house can provide comfortable life also. Some people have more willing to spend their assets on other entertainment, for them, the house is not the first place in their life. For example, lots of people are really into camping in this modern society, so they spent more money on  camping facilities or cars which allow them to live outside.",
        "The price of  houses is increasing considerably  before. Traditional thinking from parents makes young people have  pressure on purchasing a house, but the level of the salary rise cannot follow up with the speed of the house price. Nowadays, people tend to work hard to survive first in this competitive world rather than pay lots of money in the house. If people borrow cash from the bank to own a house, it sometimes gives the young generation more stress.",
        "In conclusion, not all people have the ability to obtain a house easily, sometimes people wonder to put their working results on other things. For me, I totally accept this point that it is not so important to own a house"
