        "In this modern era, technology has a great impact on peoples' lives. Some people thing that the internet has disappear the barrier of distances between people to communicate globally. Whereas others believe that it restrict the individuals to socialize. This essay discusses both the view and my position on the above notion.",
        "To begin with, positive side of the internet is it allows people to be in contact with their near and dear one without any restriction of distance and culture. For instance, a person is living abroad for the educational purpose could contact his family and native friends and it helps him to eliminate the home sickness. Secondly, people can learn about many languages, culture and traditions with the help of internet. Thus the whole world turns into a global village due to application of the internet. Hence, the internet is a boon to individual to communicate, to learn from any corner of the world.",
        "On the other hand, extensive use of the internet lets the people aware about all information of glob, but they do not get involved in the local community which is essential to get good physical and mental health. As a result, people get isolated from their group and it leads to depression and loneliness. The student of psychology had surveyed that the internet is the most saviour cause for loneliness of a person. Moreover, communicating with the internet may introduce fake people to the commuter and they may get exploited by such wrong persons. Thus, the internet is very potential danger for the society where the members of the society might not come together as it did in the past.",
        "In conclusion, the internet is a boon to the mankind, but people use it wisely for the betterment of the society. The government should also start a campaign to spread awareness to citizen and this will bring prosperity to their lives."
