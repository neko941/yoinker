        "In today's modern life, everything is rapidly undergoing through a complete change. This changing does not only brief in ways of communicating, but also is penetrating the way people used to work in workplaces. And some people are of the opinion that due to this rapid change occurring in modern industry places, it is logical to hire young workers. However, in my opinion, some of the workers over 50s can perfectly be adapted by new modern workplaces.",
        "To begin with, one argument put forward in favour of hiring youngsters is that since they use technology in everyday life more than elderly people, thus they can connect with new modern attitudes much more. Additionally, since they have a brighter and fresher mind they can easily learn how to work with advanced and novel software. For instance, take working in high-tech industries such as computer programming as an example, since jobs like this requires great knowledge of computer science and dealing with developed calculations, so being younger may be privileged. And also, psychologists seem to have a general consensus about that memory declines with age for people, therefore they believe for many careers youngsters should be selected.",
        "By contrast, one argument put forward in support of older workers is that they have a wide range of other positive attributes that can to their working place environment. Generally, they have more work experience than those who are younger. Furthermore, since they know more about bureaucracy rules, therefore the procedure of disposing issues would be more suited and quicker.",
        "To sum up, it is obvious employing young workers and older workers happen to be very controversial. However, to me, mixing of the best qualities of old and young workers will be a more logical and rational choice."
