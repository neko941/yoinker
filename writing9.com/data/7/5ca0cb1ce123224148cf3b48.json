        "Opinions differ as to whether highly-intelligent workers such as doctors, nurses and teachers should be paid more money than athletes and celebrities whose jobs involve less extensive knowledge. In my opinion, I disagree with this statement as I think that both sides should be equally paid.",
        "It is understandable why professional workers deserve a high salary. The first reason is that they have to spend many years studying and researching in tertiary education. For example, to become a truly professional practitioner in Vietnam, a medical student is supposed to study diligently 6 years in a row, then they must accomplish more than 3 years of doing research in order to obtain master degrees. Furthermore, doctors and nurses are directly dealing with human life, and thus the pressure and responsibility in treating patients are very high. At the same time, teachers play a pivotal role in both educating and training the young generation. Without them, there will be no qualified professors like doctors and scientists who drive the country forward.",
        "However, it might be unfair to consider the contributions of sports and entertainment individuals inferior to those discussed above, which means they are not deserved to be well-paid. In fact, those who work in entertainment areas also devote a great deal of time to practice or enhance themselves with an attempt to content the audience. Take singers, for example, they have to exercise their voice and dancing on a daily basis to capture the interest of the audience. In addition, despite hard work, not all singers can become internationally or just nationally acclaimed due to the unpredictable of show business. However, even if being famous, a huge number of fans could threaten their privacy and freedom whenever going out.",
        "In conclusion, while workers\u2019 contributions to society vary in particular occupations, I believe that professional and less intellectually demanding workers should be paid equally."

    "submitter": "People\u2019s life expectancy in the 21st century has been rising  an unprecedented scale. As a result, policymakers are now csidering extending the working age for old people. Prolged life is,  the e hand, a welcome change for many individuals, yet I believe this is completely not a good idea for old people to ctinue to work due to several reass related to their deteriorated work performance and capability to adapt to new technologies. Breakthroughs in medicine and heightened awareness of nutriti are the two key factors leading to lgevity. For example, nanotechnology, with tiny robots being injected into patients\u2019 body and mending all their damaged organs, are believed to the e of the secrets to obliterate any currently incurable diseases such as cancer. Additially, people nowadays are better aware of the importance of a good diet, and such wise csumpti can ensure good health and csequently extended age. However, extending people\u2019s working age can be a catastrophe to both senior citizens and companies. The majority of people at the age of 65 or over, especially in developing countries, are unable to maintain the same degree of performance as their younger counterparts. This would eventually give rise to many unwanted repercussis that affect the company\u2019s overall profits and the persal life of the aged workers as well. Also, the fast-paced life requires quick adapti and adjustments to new technology, and this is something that the elderly may never be  par with the younger es. It is not an overstatement to say that it is a torture to work in a place where you are both physically and technologically inferior to your younger co-workers. In cclusi, my firm cvicti is that old people should not be involved in work any lger than their designated retirement age now. If the need for workforce is urgent, old people can, to a certain extent, work as csultants or mentors rather than the main labor force. 30 minutes \u2013 323 words \u2013 computer-delivered",
