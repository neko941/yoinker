        "Dear Mr. Thompson",
        "We met on the airplane, two months ago while travelling from Frankford to Toronto. I am the girl who helped you find your seat and also sat next to you during the flight.",
        "You explained your plan for the opening of your restaurant branch on Yorkville Avenue in Toronto when you see my enthusiasm in the food industry. Actually, I was looking forward to meeting you and have a delightful conversation about the job opportunity that you mentioned during our journey. As I mentioned during our conversation I\u2019m working as an accountant in Amber bar which only provides service during summer due to the weather condition. So right now I am looking for a full-time job, especially at a restaurant or bar.",

My job experience and my personality have helped me to get along with all kinds of attitude and I think our corporation not only would benefit my career but also it has major advantages for you and your business.",
