        "It is a thought conceived by some that tertiary institutions should integrate sports into all degree courses and make it mandatory in order to mitigate the growing population of overweight people. In my opinion, I completely agree that sports should be a must in varsities because of the health benefits it could result.",
        "To begin with, the impact of sporting activities on human physical health has clear advantages. Firstly, the rate of obesity has being on the rise and this has hindered a lot of people's health, however, with the implementation of compulsory sports for all degree courses, the level of obesed people would greatly plummet. Secondly, students would become more active and smart rather than being sedentary. For example, people who participate frequently in sports and physical games tend to be agile with good physical posture. For theses reasons, it has been shown that sports have benefits and should be seen as important.",
        "In addition, the effects of sports on the mental health of humans can be seen as advantageous. Rather than the study of only theoretical knowledge in the universities, sport courses should be embedded into all degrees because it helps the brain to maintain fast processing of thoughts and full mental alertness. Furthermore, after most academic works the brain is usually tired and begins to experience fatigue whereas sport could help the brain relax and recuperate to assimilate better. For instance, on an average most people who engage in sports are more brilliant and successful in school work. Thus, from here, it is clear that sport courses would be a positive for the health of people.",
        "To conclude, I absolutely agree that universities embed sport into all disciplines which would be beneficial to the health of many. Secondary and primary schools should also act likewise to produce a future free of overweight people."
