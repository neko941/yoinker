        "Because of the technological advancements criminal activities are reducing at a higher rate than past days. Although in some cases offenders are making network using technology, I strongly believe that the crimes are declining at a good pace because of the scientific inventions.",
        "Crime rate is falling due to the application of most effective crime detection machineries by the policemen. Some of the tracking devices are so advanced that these could easily find out the position of the evildoers. Moreover, a person\u2019s every movement could be followed by the law enforcers through video recording system that person seems suspicious. Likewise, a criminal\u2019s picture and punishment regarding this could be made viral through media broadcasting to make the people aware not to commit such things. Furthermore, there are also some smart equipment currently using in the labs to identify clues from the specimens. Thus, using these machines by the police officers not only facilitates the process of criminal identification, but also the prevention of crime. For instance, installing video-surveillance-system in important roads has decreased the traffic offences more than 50% in India.",
        "On the other hand, offenders can comfortably make network through the electronic devices. No matter where the mischief-makers are staying, they can easily make new contacts and transmit information through online.  That is how it is easy to enhance the criminal activities with the electronic devices. Some recent terrorist activities over the world are examples of this. However, all these wrong doings could be tracked using modern instruments. For example, a recent illegal bank transaction in Bangladesh is detected by using a software.",
        "In conclusion, despite the fact that the networking of the mischiefs is enhancing in some cases because of the technology, the number of offences are getting down due to the smart detection system. Therefore, until the modern machineries are employed effectively, the level of crime will significantly get down."
