        "Films are considered as one of the influential art forms. Violence in the movies has created many problems in the societies.",
        "One of the main problems affected in the society by the movies is the violence. In most of the movies, the lead character does tremendous fight in different styles. The movie is regarded as a most influential art form. The viewers, especially youngsters try to apply the same style and create problems in the society. In films different type of violence is being used, some violence are much scarier and children\u2019s are advised not to see such kind of movie's. In the videos, violence is done to capture something from someone. For instance, of stealing money from a rich man, they will kill the wealthy man and loot his all money; similarly violence is done to capture power or money. The solution is that the violence in the movies should be reduced or when the violence is being shown, subtitle mentioning ''violence is not a solution for all'' should be shown.",
        "The violence in the films should be limited or to be ignored, since this a great influential art form. The society inherits this and tries to apply the same. Violence in the movies with a gun or machines, or with any sharp objects should be subject to screening and this type of movies should not be promoted. Instead of violence, they should focus more on showing an empathy, peace. Thus, they can develop a good society. The violence affects the children\u2019s and the effects of violence will be there in their mind gradually they will try to implement those in their lives and thus destroy the society.",
        "In conclusion the violence in the films has caused several problems and this should be avoided, the government mechanism should be more active to ban such type of films by doing proper screening."
