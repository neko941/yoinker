        "Although food production is developed, a plenty of people all over the world still suffer from famine. The distinct causes of this lie in the lack of resources and money in these areas, but pecuniary aid from wealthy countries should be adopted to tackle this problem.",
        "One of the main reasons of the starvation despite advanced agriculture is insufficient resources such as water and applicable soil due to the fact that most of these hungry members of society live in inhospitable deserts or other type of areas of the world, which are completely inconvenient for life. This can be exemplified by how some African dwellers are struggling for the cup of water and trying to withstand, whilst more than half of humanity exist in the abundance.  The second reason that might be noted, in my perspective, is poverty of these people, which means that the more the economy is collapsing, the more they can\u2019t afford to purchase something to eat. As a result, the famine comes and this part of the public has to endure it.",
        "To combat this issue rich countries around the world may help these suffering people by allocating finance and make a contribution to the development of the poor countries, and this can be the most efficient way to maintain a myriad of human life from famine, which is experiencing extremely rapid spread from year to year.",
        "In conclusion, the indigence of some nations and shortage of resources are the foremost causes, which can be solved by financial support from other prosperous states, but actions should be taken urgently, otherwise a cluster of people will continue to suffer."
