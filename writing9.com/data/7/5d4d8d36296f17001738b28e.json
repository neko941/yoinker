        "Younger generations in some nations are avoiding their right to vote. The main problem this causes is that leaders cannot address the issues of young people and the most viable solution is for the government to sponsor awareness campaigns in media and colleges.",
        "The primary problem of this trend is that politicians cannot solve the problems of young people. In other words, leaders are not aware of what younger individuals want from them because they have not given their opinion. Therefore, their issue can unheard and they will think about the public who have given their contribution to elections. For example, according to a report published by BBC in the year 2016, 40% of young people have not given their votes in general elections. Thus, the government stops addressing young generations for their issues.",
        "A possible solution to this predicament is that the authorities should educate younger individuals about their rights through organizing campaigns in universities. That is to say that the government could shed some light on this situation to aware youth about the consequences of not giving their vote. As a result, they will understand how important is to give an opinion for their betterment and the government can make laws that will be beneficial for their future. For instance, a similar initiative implemented in Ireland and this resulted in a 30% increase in the number of young people who cast their votes in last elections.",
        "In conclusion, young people are not giving their votes in few countries and the problem of this approach is that Politicians do not give importance to their issues and to solve this problem the government should arrange campaigns to aware youth of the importance of the vote."
