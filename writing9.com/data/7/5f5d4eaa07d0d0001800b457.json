        "Few individuals are of the opinion that developing countries would appreciate financial help from international organisations to aid progress while some others believe practical guidance will be more efficient. This essay will discuss both arguments and also give my unsolicited opinion.",
        "Firstly, quite a few humans agree that international coy should provide financial help to underdeveloped countries while some think hard work and counsel would be better for their advancement. Supporting countries that are not developed with money would go a long way in the expansion of better infrastructures which in turn give them a good standard of living. For instance, the World Health Organization recently supported my country, Nigeria with two hundred dollars to eradicate poverty in all the states. This will indeed help uplift the underprivileged to a good lifestyle.",
        "Few people agree that practical aid and consultation from abroad countries will improve evolution to financial support. This opinion is also great because the growing countries need to learn from practical ways of how the developed countries have grown, also the technical guidance is also necessary so as to avoid failure. For example, the United State of America recently tips Nigerian government on ways to eradicate terrorism. There a quite a lot to achieve from this to grow the economy.",
        "In conclusion, the suggestion of financial help and practical mentoring both have lot of significance to develop countries but, I will strongly suggest financial help because the rate of poverty in under-developed countries is really high and the financial help would reduce it immediately to an extent."
