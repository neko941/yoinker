        "Undoubtedly, there are different ways of showing our love to the people around us. Although some people think that giving gifts and presents is a better way to show our affection for our near and dear ones, others opine that there are other effective methods to show that we care and I agree with this. In this essay I shall discuss the different views of the people and also give my opinion in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "Some people think that it is imperative to give gifts and presents to friends and family to show the affection. This is because these things are tangible which persistently reminds them that there is someone who cares for them. To illustrate, people living overseas usually give ornaments and other expensive items to family members to show their love. The argument is that since they are miles apart nothing can prove their love as well as these gifts.",
        "Conversely, there are various ways other than gifting to show love. For example, in some Indian families the daughter-in-law shows her caring nature by serving her in-laws and looking after them. Likewise, the son-in-law may provide for his wife\u2019s parents. As a result, the family bonding increases and a healthy relationship are built. Such kind and selfless deeds create joy in the family.",
        "In my opinion, expensive items are not always necessary to reveal the affection. The other methods such as, spending precious time with dear ones and taking care of them physically and emotionally play a significant role in showing love.",
        "In conclusion, though gifts sometimes serve as a means to show our caring nature, especially in long distance relationships these things are short lived; instead sharing quality time with friends and family and assisting them whenever they need help can be a better way to show that we care."
