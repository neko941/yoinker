        "People define happiness in a different terms. Some people opine that pleasure comes within; while, many others consider outer objects as a source of prosperity. I have discussed both the perspective of bliss before coming to a conclusion.",
        "To begin with, many individuals held themselves responsible for well-being because they believe happiness is a state of satisfactory feeling, and they do not need to depend on others to pursue their well-being. Those people believe, enjoyment is not attached with any external factors, but internal peace of mind. When a person fills satisfied within own self, he feels happy.  For example, one survey has revealed that 60% people who marked themselves satisfied are happier than those who are dissatisfied. Hence, everyone is responsible for their delight.",
        "On the other aspect hand, many people think, that prosperity can be massively affected by surrounding factors. One feels happier when he is surrounded by people who support and motivate him. For instance, one survey has revealed , generally, people are happier when they are with their friends and family because they feel more secure and content. Additionally, many individuals consider money as a source of enjoyment. They feel happy showing off their wealth to others. Resulting, materialistic things impart them a sense of satisfaction.",
        "In conclusion, I believe happiness is a feeling of satisfaction and I think every individual is responsible to feel satisfied with their own choices and decisions of life. Although, other objects can be reason of temporary optimism. However, if someone's not happy with themselves no other thing can keep them happy for a long period. Thus, a balance of both is important for joy."
