        "Recently, extensive attention has been put on international aid organizations. Some people argue that celebrities can make people pay attention to problems when they give a hand to  organizations. Other people believe that the problems become less critical with the support from celebrities. I would support the former view.",
        "On one hand, one problem with  famous people's help is that it may mislead the public about charity. People may believe that only individuals with fame and fortune can give support to those international aid organizations. For example, people are unlikely to participate in helping vulnerable groups because they think that they are not wealthy enough to provide facilities or devices for people in need. As a result, people are not willing to contribute to a charity and they will rely on  celebrities to give a helping hand to those organizations.",
        "On the other hand, the influence power of famous people cannot be ignored because they have advertisement effect. Those well-known people can have a huge influence on their fans. This is because many fans see their idols as role models. They can learn a lot from their idols. For example, If the celebrity participates in charity events such as showing their support to children in a developing country, their fans will be likely to give their support to those children and do some volunteer jobs. Therefore, due to the influence of those famous people, more and more people will join in charity events.",
        "In conclusion, although it may mislead the public when celebrities show their supports to the international aid organizations, I would argue that their influence power cannot be ignored, which can make more people pay attention to charity."
