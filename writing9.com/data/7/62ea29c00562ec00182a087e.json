        "Nowadays, more and more people are affected by  fitness issues such as well-being and heart disease which are linked to overconsumption of cheap mass-produced food .Some public belief the only so;caution is to make  fast meals less affordable by taxing them highly .Despite the severity of the problem ,I think this is quite wrong .Increasing  fast food would unfairly penalise people and may not necessarily bring about the desired health benefits.",
        "First ,fast food is about more than just nutrition .Many teenagers spend money on fast food because they need to eat out but  this is how they socialise .Fast food restaurants provide a safe,convenient place for young people to meet friends .Denying people a small pleasure in life could  affect their social lives or happiness.",
        "Another important point is that ,if the reason for taxing junk food is to reduce obesity ,it may be ineffective.It is true that fast food is high in sugar ,salt and fat ,all of which cause weight gain and are detrimental to our health,besides taxing there might be other factors which make it detrimental to our health such as containing trans-fat  .While a home-cooked meal is generally healthy,this is not always the case .I personally know a family that used to eat high-fat ,home-cooked food in enormous portions .They all suffered from health problems due to obesity.",
        "On the opposite ,I do understand the point of view of those who say ,drastic action is needed .If fast food  was taxed and became expensive ,individuals  would be forced to seek out healthier options .In addition,food producers would have an incentive to provide healthier foods .Nevertheless,there is likely to be resistance from consumers and producers who want to have a greater choice.",
        "To conclude,although imposing a higher tax on fast snacks could have more positive effects ,these would be outweighed by the drawbacks .For one thing ,some sectors of society would feel victimised ,and there is also the fact that simply raising taxes would not result in a much healthier society .What we really need is a greater awareness of diet and cheaper healthy cuisine,"
