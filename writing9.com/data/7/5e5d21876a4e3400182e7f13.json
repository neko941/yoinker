        "It is an irrefutable fact that the trend of following celebrities among youngster rapidly increasing. Some people assert that most of the famous folks are known by their style and money as compared to their achievements and this would be a bad impact on teenagers.",
        "In my opinion, I totally disagree with the statement, youngsters influence by their bad habits. In this essay, I intend to support my views before reasonable conclusion can be drawn.",
        "There are several reasons why it does not influence badly on teens. Firstly, the person who becomes a celebrity, it means they have talent and best skills that\u2019s why they are famous. Furthermore, if they have a beautiful face, that\u2019s the main logic because nobody has glamour by nature. Moreover, if they struggle a-lot in his past life for that he is wealthy. For an example, there are many popular people who struggle in their life, after that they have all this things such as drake and so on.",
        "On the contrary side, most of the people attract by atrocious activities such as abusing in public and abuse drugs. In addition. This type of things could bad impact on the young generation. For an instance, the famous singer  honey Singh lost his career because of using drugs and using bad language in songs.",
        "To put in a nutshell, I pen down and say that  we don\u2019t judge people by their glamour and richness. There are lots of struggle behind those people. It depends on people, which things they are followed bad or good things."
