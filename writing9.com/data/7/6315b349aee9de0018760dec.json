        "How is going for you? I hope everything is ok at your end and with your family. I hope you are pretty well doing in your career. Speaking of that, I need to tell you about my profession. Recently, I have changed my job.",
        "As I told you earlier, my old working environment was pretty much toxic and always very hectic. Due to that, I actually had not had any work-life balance. Not only that there was too much politics in the workplace because my ex-supervisor would expect me to produce more than the scope that I should be working on. And her expectation was too high so I can never achieve up to her level. As a result, she always gave me bad feedback in my performance appraisal even though I performed very well and I achieved beyond the expectation.",
        "Well, in this new profession, the working environment is very healthy. The superior seems to be a fair and square person. He knows very well that taking care of the employees is one of the best strategies in order to take care of business. So far, I have work-life harmony and because of that, now I can upgrade myself well with the latest state-of-the-art technologies. I am earning at least two professional certifications so far in the past 3 months.",
        "The other good news is that I bought a two-storey landed house with a small garden. I am planting so many flowers in my garden and you know waking up with the smell of fresh flowers makes my mind fresh too. Anyway, I am talking too much and I nearly forgot to remind you to come to my upcoming birthday next month. I will see you and your family around then.",
        "Till then, take care and be safe.",
        "Your friend,",
