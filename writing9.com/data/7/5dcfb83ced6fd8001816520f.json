        "Parents cast an important role in carving the future of their pupil.They are not only responsible  for his up-bringing, but as well as shaping him into a kind hearted person.In the recent years, there has been an argument on the achievement of a man as an adult is mainly dependent on the way he was treated by his parents during his teenage years.From my perspective, I strongly believe that parents are partly or fully responsible for the milestone's achieved in life by their children.",
        "Parents always consider their children as a kid, no matter how old he grows.This is mainly because of the love and affection towards them.Parents sacrifice a lot of things in order to build a safe and a bright future for their children.From teaching them how to behave with elders to making them responsible, parents play an important part.In addition, they also teach them how to tackle problems in various phases of life without giving up on them.For instance, if their child is upset over some reason, they will always enquire about it and show him the ways to get out of it.",
        "However, due to bad influences, there have been many cases of children deflecting from their paths and ending up as a failure.Having said this, you cannot judge the parents of an unsuccessful kid and question their up bringing towards him.They have always tried to give their child the best treatment they could.In contrast, if he has failed in the exam of life does not make his parents responsible for the failure.For example, Orphan kids have also turned out to be successful in life.This outweighs the fact that bringing up by parents if wholly responsible for the success in life.",
        "To sum up, every parent want their children to achieve something big in life and grow up to be a successful person.Judging the failure of one's life depending upon the way he was nurtured by his parents is completely a false way of accusing someone.Questioning the up bringing of parents should be not be a topic to argue with."
