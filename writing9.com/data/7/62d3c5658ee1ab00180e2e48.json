        "I am writing to request you  grant me a leave of absence for 2 days. As you know, the customer was extremely disappointed with our previous delivery as their expectation regarding quality and the timeline of the release was too high. To meet their requirement, I had been working consecutively for 3 weeks even on the weekends. Now, considering the number of hours I spent in the office in a few days, I have decided to take a short break from work.",
        "I am planning a short vacation on November 21st and 22nd. As the following days are weekends, I will get a total of 4 days of  holiday. I would like to visit my native place during these holidays and get some time for myself before commencing work on the upcoming project.",
        "I assure you that my absence will in no way affect my work as my teammate Sara has agreed to fill me for me. Even though I was on travel, I will continuously monitor my email inbox and reply to customer queries without delay.",
