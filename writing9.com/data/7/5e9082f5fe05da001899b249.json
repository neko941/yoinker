        "Let me illustrate further about the situation, it's my sister\u2019s wedding, which is due next week on the given dates. Since it's a wedding there are heaps of work; for instance, organising, hosting and managing the event, and most of it is pending. Moreover, my father cannot handle everything by himself as he is diabetic and hypertensive, and so there is a strict regime that he need to follow and plus he is not allowed to take stress anytime at all. Therefore, in order to make things run smoothly I need to be there to handle all of this.",
        "Furthermore, my shift ends around 7 P.M, and thus it would extremely helpful if you could allow me leave by 5 p.m. In addition to this, the wedding is on the 11th of April and everything needs to sort out before that. Even though it's just two hours, but that would be sufficient enough to assist and manage the pending task.",
        "In my absence, my colleague Mr.Sadik Fumakiya would handle my assignments till the required time, and also he would contact me for daily report as well as inform if there are any emergencies. Additionally, I shall be working overtime to complete all the unfinished tasks. I hope you would understand my situation and take actions favourably.",
