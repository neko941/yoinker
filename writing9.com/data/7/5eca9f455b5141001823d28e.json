        "It is a usual belief that a group of people gets inherent expertise for sports and music but others argue that a proper learning environment can make anyone good as anyone those. In my opinion, I consider that if an emphasis is given on practice and training, a child from any background can excel in sports or music.",
        "On the one hand, a common thought is that only people having inborn talents can be excellent in sports and music. In other words, institutional training can have a little impact on being renowned sportsman or music person. For instance, Diego Maradona, the legendary footballer from a poor country such as Argentina became great by virtue of his inborn qualities. Furthermore, people having intrinsic skills are always apart from other people in the field of sports and music.",
        "On the other hands, some people assume that by ensuring a good platform for practicing and training can make anyone an outstanding sportsman or music person and I agree with it. Every individual has some hidden potential and can be sharpened by proper care. For example, born without a gifted talent signer like A.R. Khan from India won Oscar by his hard work and avid desire for learning. Music and sports require a lot practice and training to remain competitive and so only being keen on learning and practice can drive anybody to the peak of success in those fields.",
        "In conclusion, while many vary in their opinion, I think that anybody can be a superb sportsman or a musician by dint of taking required practice and training."
