Many pupils have started to work during their academic studies. As per my opinion, this diversity having a plethora of gains and few demerits is there. The essay will discuss both above notions with supporting arguments in below paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there are manifold merits of working as a student. The predominate advantage is that a student can get an idea about the real world.

Although, this type of activity teaches the value of crucial factor such as time and money, this helps them to balance their studies and work. Moreover, by working at an early age will make a person responsible and grow their confidence to deal with any situation. For example, Research conducted shows that by starting a job person would learn a skill such as punctuality and maintain their finance.",
        "On the other hand, this change having few detrimental impacts on the disciple. The first demerit is that some of the jobs need more attention of the pupil. Due to this type of work a child is suffering from the health issues. However, they would not be able to give a concentration on their studies.
