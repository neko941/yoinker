        "It is often argued that the secret for success is working hard. While some people believe that to have a substantial impact on the world they should dedicate their lives to their professions, I would argue that a balance between work and life is crucial to achieve a pivotal position.",
        "Working for long hours with no rest time is a trend in this globalised world. Because of that, people are getting sick and developing mental disturbs, such as burnout syndrome. For instance, neurosurgeons usually perform long shifts, with no time to rest between one procedure and another, leading them to a situation of extreme tiredness. If this picture was prohibited by law, forcing them to spend less time on their jobs, it would lead to more effective work. As a result, workers would be more satisfied with their jobs, therefore, performing better.",
        "Furthermore, people who spend most of their lives working usually does not have a family or loved ones. To illustrate, in urban cities, there is a growing number of single men and women working more than 10 hours a day. Since they do not have a person to share the conquests, they tend to work even more, leading to a vicious circle. As a consequence, these people feel incomplete, thus the sense of fulfilment is difficult to be reached.",
        "In conclusion, although it is common sense that hard-work leads to success, it does not mean that work should be the only activity exerted. In order to achieve fulfilment, balance between work and personal life is vital and should be encouraged by employers and communication media.It is often argued that the secret for success is working hard. While some people believe that to have a substantial impact on the world they should dedicate their lives to work, I would argue that a balance between professional and social is crucial to achieve a pivotal position in our society."
