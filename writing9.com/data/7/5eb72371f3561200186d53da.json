        "Online shopping is gaining more and more popularity among people. Indeed, this will have a huge effect on the environment because less people will be spending their time in shopping malls and this will make such places cleaner and less crowded. Moreover, more job categories will emerge, such as website designers and social media influencers.",
        "Despite some challenges, online shopping will give the surroundings a chance to breathe. Furthermore, people will stop polluting many places where they used to shop the items that they need. For instance, the less people visiting big stores, the less transporation fuels emerging through the atmosphere and this will eventually have a positive impact on the environment. Therefore, buying things through various websites will offer extremely important benefits to the surroundings.",
        "In contrast, while many jobs will be less important such as, salesmen and cashiers, other professional opportunities will have a more significant role such as, those software engineers who are needed to design websites and keep their maintainance. In addition, these changes will have a subsequent effect on the types of jobs required in the professional field. For example, IT field is now considered one of the highly valued careers all over the world. Consequently, it's logical to believe that although some expertise will become rudimentary, others will become more relevant.",
        "In conclusion, buying things online is experiencing an increasing trend recently. While people prefer to stay home, they won't pollute department stores during their visit to such places and this will give nature a chance to heal. In fact, this will also impact the labour world and different kind of specialists will be required to cope with such recent phenomena."
