        "It is a trend\u00a0that more people have their employers' permission\u00a0to work at home rather than in offices. I definitely believe that this phenomenon is beneficial to human history because of\u00a0 the advantages for employees and their employers.\u00a0The essay will list two advantages, such as\u00a0\u00a0flexible working schedule and time saving while working at home.",
        "To begin with, working at home provides a flexible working schedule\u00a0 because employees will have access to their tasks online via computers at any time.\u00a0For example, writers and journalists are able to compose their articles at home and then summit them via e-mail online. As a result, they can carry out their tasks anytime during the days, basing on their\u00a0personal working schedules.\u00a0Without office time limitation, employees will be able to organize their time more flexibly. Moreover, they will feel more delight\u00a0because there are no limitation of strict office hours and free\u00a0monitoring from their supervisors.\u00a0As a result , this will lead to\u00a0more production by happy employees and add more profit for\u00a0companies.",
        "In addition, working at home will help employees to save much time. In the contemporary era,\u00a0especially living a metropolis, many people need to spend many hours in commuting daily. For example, many local residents\u00a0living in General Toronto Area spend 2-3 hours daily in\u00a0commuting to work because many of them live in a suburban region due to extremely high housing price in downtown Toronto. Therefore, working at home will save much\u00a0time for them daily so that they will have more time for their personal life or family as well. Saving time and energy to commute to work will help employees to focus on their jobs either. Furthermore, working at home in their private place will enhance employees' efficiency as well.",
        "Overall, working at home will not only bring many benefits for certain kinds of employees, but also will enhance the product. Moreover, it also provides a flexible schedules for employees and help employees to save time.\u00a0Therefore, allowing employees to work at home will bring positive contribute to companies and societies."
