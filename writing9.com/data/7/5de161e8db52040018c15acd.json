        "IN CONTEMPORARY ERA, PROGRAMMABLE ROBOTICS ARE PROLIFERATING  AT AN ALARMING RATE. THERE IS A GROWING PERCEPTION IN THE SOCIETY THAT ALL OCCUPATIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY ROBOTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WHILE, I BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THE MEINAL AS WELL AS REGOROUS JOBS ARE LIKELY TO BE HEADED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLEGENCE; HOWEVER, OTHERS THAT REQUIRE HUMAN PRESENCE WILL REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF HUMAN ONLY. THIS ESSAY WILL DISCUSS ABOUT THE REASONS  SUPPORTING  MY OPINION.",
        "TO EMBARK ON, ROBOTS MAY REPLACE HUMAN BEINGS IN ALL THOSE JOBS WHICH DONOT REQUIRE ANY KIND OF SPECIFIC SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE. THE MAIN REASON BEHIND THIS TREND IS, EMPLOYING ROBOTS FOR SIMPLE TASKS WILL CONSIDERABLY REDUCE THE COST OF EMPLOYING THE MANPOWER. IN ADDITION, THE TOUGH JOBS THAT MAY JEOPARDISE THE LIVES OF HUMANS, WILL DEFENATELY BE CARRIED OUT BY MACHINES. COAL MINING, FOR EXAMPLE, IS A CUMBERSOME TASK FOR A LIVING CREATURE, WHEREAS, SUCH THREATENING JOBS WILL BE COMPLETED BY COMPUTER OPERATED MACHINE WITHOUT BEING CHANCE OF ANY MENANCE. THUS, IT IS CLEARLY VISIBLE THAT ROBOTS CAN FACILITATE THE INDUSTORY THROUGH MULTIPLE WAYS.",
        "ON THE OTHER SIDE, ADMITTEDLY, THOSE OCCUPATIONS THAT DEMAND HUMAN CONTACT AND THEIR ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT WILL NEVER LET DOWN. SIGNIFICANCE OF HUMANS IN SOME JOBS SUCH AS EDUCATION, PSYCHOLOGY, MEDICINES  WILL REMAINAS IT AS FOR AGES.  LACKING IN EXPRESSIONS,  ABSENCE OF WORD COMMAND, AND BEING NON EMOTIONAL, ARE THE FACORTS PROVING ROBOTS INCOMPETENT FOR SOME SPECIFIC JOBS. AS PER EDUCATIONISTS,THE STUDY CONTENT TAUGHT BY SOME SOFTWARE PROGRAMMS SEEMS  JUST LIKE SEDENTARY TALKS DUE TO ABSENCE OF EXPRESSIONS, WHICH WILL NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE AS EXPLAINED BY A TEACHER, WHO,  NOT ONLY  PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY, BUT ALSO FOSTER NEW LIFE IN STUDENTS THROUGH  VARIETY OF GESTURES. HENCE, ITCAN BE SAID THAT ALL  JOBS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR ROBOTS.",
        "TO SUM UP, DESPITE OF THE FACT THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS INCORPRATED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT IN DAY TO DAY LIFE, NONTHELESS, DENIABLE FACT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF MANPOWER WILL NEVER BE COMPLETELY OMITTED FROM THE WORLD."
