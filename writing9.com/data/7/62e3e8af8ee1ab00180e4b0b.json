        "We understand that in some nations, governments are forcing heavy taxes on fuels to eradicate environmental situations. There are a lot of advantages as well as disadvantages to this approach.",
        "Looking at the situation, I would say it is a very essential and necessary method to embark on by imposing huge returns on fuels to solve the environmental crisis. By doing so, it would limit pollution, climate change, land degradation, overpopulation et cetera because most people won't be able to afford to pay so much for petrol. As much as people like to live in a very civilized ambience, they would also not welcome having to spend all their life savings on a huge remit. This would in a way reduce the consumption of gas as well as a number of folk in the areas. For instance, there was fuel scarcity in my city about two months ago, I must say it was a thug of war to even get where to buy let alone the high rate at which you would buy. This makes so many people look for alternatives like alocal lap, lighting of candles,and so on to restore power in their various homes.",
        "However, it has a lot of disadvantages because so many would not be able to afford to have to pay huge taxes on electricity and tend to other household expenses given their background and social status. Roughly, Eighty per cent of the society are poor and Fifteen per cent could be able to afford it for some period of time before they retire while the remaining five per cent are wealthy, these sets of people would know how to manage their way around the situation on the ground. For example, I would like to refer back to the hoarding of petroleum in my area, during this period it was difficult to purchase fuel and there was also no power surge. As such, it led to unpalatable events like Theft, burgling apartments, loss of items, and fighting that led to a few untimely death of innocent souls.",
        "In my point of view, I would say the authority should be fair while imposing certain laws even though it is for the betterment of the nation. It would be advisable to weigh their options and make the best decision that would benefit both the poor, average and wealthy communities. By doing so, the city won't suffer any loss or result in chaos due to the wrong decisions made by the law with the aim of fighting against environmental predicaments."
