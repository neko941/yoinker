THIS CHEMICALS ON LOGER PERIOD HAVE DEVASTATING EFFECTS ON HUMEN INTERNAL ORGANS. AS A RESULT, PERSON'S WELNESS LEVEL WILL BE AFFECTED AT SOME POINT. TAKE WHO SURVEY AS EXAMPLE, WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION SURVEYED THE BOTH THE GENERATION  OLD AND NEW.AND THAT SHOWED THAT OLDER GENERATION TEND TO LIVE MORE THAN 80 YEARS IN AVERAGE BECAUSE THEY USED TO EAT HEALTHY ORGANIC FOOD LIKE RICE, CURRY, WHEAT TORTILLAS ETC. WHEREAS TODAY'S DISCANDANTS ARE HABITUAL TO EAT MORE JUNK FOOD WHICH CONSIDERED AS UNHYIGENIC AND INORGANIC. THIS TREND SEEMS TO BE CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE TOO. THUS, FOOD COULD BE THE ONE CAUSE FOR DISCENDED MEDIUM STRENGTH STANDARD OF HUMAN.",

THIS LEADS TO VARIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS LIKE OBESITY, JOINTS RELATED ISSUES ETC. THIS ARE THE PROBLEM IMPACT THEIR STRENGTH TO MAJOR EXTENT. FOR INSTANCE, INDIAN RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO SPEND MORE TIME WITHOUT ANY WORKOUT ARE MORE PRONE TO GET DISEASES AT EARLY AGE WHICH WAS MOT USUALLY HAPPENED BEFORE. THUS AS REVOLUTION IN TECHNOLOGY INCREASED MORE HEALTH PROBLEMS ARRIVES WHICH MAKES THE FITNESS STANARD DESREASED.",
