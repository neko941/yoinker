        "My name is Michael and you were my 300 level turbine and piston engine teacher when I was in school. I was hoping that you might remember me as I was the only black student in the class of year 2016. I recall that you mentioned that I could use you as a reference anytime because of your  high regards for my abilities",

I will therefore appreciate if you could kindly write a reference letter on my behalf to the company. The company is one of the best maintenance, repair and overhaul companies in Quebec that operate several transport category aircraft such as Dash 8 Q400, ATR 72, Boeing 727 and ERJ 145.",
        "Apart from the knowledge and exposure, I will get from the company, I would love to work there because they are offering a high salary rate and other benefits that the position would offer. Also, they offer the opportunity to travel to different locations outside Canada to repair some of their aircraft.",
        "I would really appreciate it if you could write a letter showing my qualifications and your experience with me as your student.",
