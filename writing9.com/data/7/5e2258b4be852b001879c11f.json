        "Technology has gone a long way now, and it is providing a lot of alternatives that we can choose from that suits our own preferences. Will movie experience on mobile phone replace the one we acquire in cinemas? In this essay we will be discussing both points of view while giving my opinion in the end.",
        "First of all, Cinemas started in the early 80's and have become very popular and convenient by people of all ages. Furthermore, the cinema experience is always being enhanced by providing a variety of choices for the users like the 3D and 4DX. Although it may be sometimes expensive, but it is worth it. Moving chairs with small guns spitting water and air installed behind your ears will definitely get you out of your seat and makes you feel more involved with every asset of the film.",
        "On the other hand, Some other people prefer watching movies on their tablet or mobile devices. Mobile apps nowadays provides platforms with thousand of movies to choose from. \"Netflix\" for example provides an excellent service with  a cheap subscription. The users can sit on their couches and can play, pause, rewind any movie they like without being interrupted. Accessing any movie while at home has become very easy and preferable by many.",
        "In conclusion, choosing to watch a movie in the cinema can enhance the viewing experience, whereas some other people prefer lying on their couch while watching on their phone. In my opinion, i prefer the experience that the cinema provides,"
