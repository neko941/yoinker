        "I am a resident of Lake County Society and have been living there since my birth. I am writing this letter in response to the grapevine about council wanting to sell the local park.",
        "Since childhood, Greenville park has been hosting a plethora of events, ranging from kite flying tournaments to family picnics. As it is the only park in the area, people from other societies also cite it as a primary park. It also holds nostalgic importance among most of the residents, as they have spent a number of days here jogging, playing, and spending quality time with their loved ones.  Striping such a park would mean devouring the whole locality of greenery. Not to mention the ruckus it will create during the reconstrustion, along with the possibility of attracting unwanted public.",
        "If the council decides to go ahead with the decision, I along with the residents would register a petition against, convincing various individuals against the council's decision. Based on the initial poll we already have 70% of the residents for the petition. Hope the council decides preserve the park.",
