        "It is an irrefutable fact that tourism is the main source of income for many countries. However, a segment of society is concerned that this phenomenon is the main reason for the destruction of historical buildings. I believe that the government can address this issue by restricting the number of tourists and allocating sufficient funding to protect the sightseeings. The following paragraphs will propose remedial measures to prevent damage to historical buildings.",
        "The historical buildings were not built to not accommodate such a huge number of visitors. Therefore, restricting the number of people entering the building can result in the prevention of historic dwellings. There is a clear link between the number of people and inflicted harm. Take, for example, Samarkand. Entrance to some of the historical constructions was limited by the number of visitors. As a result, those buildings were less exposed to external harm.",
        "Another possible solution to this issue would be allocating a sufficient budget and increasing entrance fees in order to preserve and maintain construction. The government's allocated budget could be spent on timely cleaning, painting and proving other necessary maintaining activities. For example, the government of India  released more money to preserve the Taj Mahal in 2005. As a result, today, the Taj Mahal is still beautiful. By increasing the entrance fees to historical buildings, the government would have a less monetary burden.",
        "In conclusion, if special measures are not taken to prevent historic buildings from the drawbacks of the tourism sector, this issue will only escalate. I believe that governments play a critical role to play to ensure a rich world heritage for future generations."
