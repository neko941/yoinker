        "It is often said that pictures speak louder than words. I suppose this maxim goes well with the way news stories are presented by newspapers and television channels. Some people say that it is better to use more pictures. I agree with this viewpoint.",
        "A pictorial and graphical depiction of news stories can be very appealing and convincing. It can also cheer up the mood of the readers. For example, a candid image of a rejoicing sports team after winning a world cup trophy. For example, a candid image of a rejoicing sports team after winning a world cup trophy will warm many hearts. Sometimes, it may just take a single picture to narrate a sordid tale or describe the enormity of the situation. For instance, a front page image of a crying child in a flood affected surrounding speaks volumes. To cite another example, the picture of the grieving family of a martyred solider can have quite an impact on the reader / the nation.",
        "Furthermore, news with photos arouses the reader\u2019s interest to a large extent. In my favourite newspaper \u2018Bombay Times\u2019, pictures of various celebrities compel me to read the articles about them. Depending on our interest area, a related image can draw our attention to read the entire article.",
        "In summary, I believe pictures in the newspapers and TV channels can create a lasting impression on our mind with their positive, powerful or heart-rending message. They also make the news stories more interesting and easy to comprehend."
