        "It is universally  acknowledged  that  the problem  related  to smoking  is increasing  at an alarming  rate  across the globe.  It is very dangerous  for the lungs  not only  for  smokers but also for the other people who  stay with them.  The assertion  seems pretty  controversial across the world.  Without  any doubt, society is divided  into two groups as per the distinct mindsets of different folks.  A fair amount  of people  believe  that  it would  be beneficial  if the government make smoking  illegal  in public places  whether others claim that's  not enough  to stop smoking  other methods are also needed  . Whether  to agree or not it's a tough-provoking  question.  As far as I see it's more justified  to agree with the second  statement  that there are others things to do than just ban smoking  publicly.  In upcoming paragraphs,  I will shed light on both sides  but also elaborate on my point of view.",
        "To embark,  if we have a deep look we can find a plethora  of reasons why people  agreed with  the first  statement  . The first and foremost reason behind this is it is very common  to see people  smoke  in public  places such as bus stops, supermarkets, outside of  hospitals or schools etc . In such ,places all aged people  go every day and meet smokers.  As a result, old people  and children consume smoke &cigarette which is very harmful to them.  That's  the reason  why people  think  it would  be great  if smoking gets banned  from public places . for instance, there are so many places where smoking  is completely  banned  like hospitals  , schools  , public transport  and temples . It's  a great step  to have a beautiful  and pure environment.",
        "On the paradoxical  side , other communities claim that there are so many other activities  we can do . First and foremost,  we can be aware  people of the side effects of smoking.  People  can organize  small events to show the bad effects of  smoking  . Secondly,  we can advertise  the side effects of smoking  . Additionally,  if the government  increase  the cost of  cigarettes then sales will be decreased . Last not least,  huge penalties  against  smoking . It will help a lot to reduce  the  number of smokers. For example,  police charge huge money if any student gets caught  smoking.",
        "In conclusion,  there is no denying  the fact that the problem  related to smoking  increasing at an alarming rate . It's  our duty to take it under control  and it's  not impossible.  With the help of people .we can make this globe a better  place to live because hard work pay-off."
