        "First, last Thursday, March 11 we came back home and I found an old friend of mine with her daughters inside my home.This surprise was prepared with my husband and also her daughters are close friends of mine, however, we have not met since 2015.As a result, the girls turn on the CD player and started celebrating their gathering.",
        "Second, I am sorry for the noise we cause suddenly at night as we stayed until 11:00 pm. On that day we totally forgot about the noise and we did not consider it in our minds as we were all excited.",
        "Third, I promise this will not happen again under any case and we will be more careful if we are celebrating any event at home.Furthermore, we just moved into this house recently and I did not accept that the sound isolation is not 100 percent effective.",
        "Finally, I would like to repeat my apology for what happened and I will be waiting for you in my house next Monday to have a cup of coffee together.",
