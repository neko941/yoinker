        "The swift happening in the world, especially in the field of technology has indeed raised a number of questions on the educational frontier. The importance of handwriting in one such yet a niche area to be rethought off.",
        "In olden days, physical written artefacts served as was the main mode of recording, archiving, publishing or even for communicating. A decent, understandable and clear writing was a prerequisite for most of the jobs while good hand writing was considered a leverage as it added the aesthetics associated with any written ideology owing to which the handwriting was prioritized as a critical aspect of early education.Not only did it enhance the look but also it brought in a disciple with rigorous practice. However the advancement in technology resulted in the replacement of written transcripts by computer typed reducing the above described advantage.",
