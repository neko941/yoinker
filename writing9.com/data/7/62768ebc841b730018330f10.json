        "I am writing to suggest ways of improving the level of accessibility for disabled people in our town.",
        "The first issue, which must be tackled is the lack of facilities for public transport. One possible decision is to make buses and taxis wheelchair accessible. In this way, disabled people will have the opportunity to travel everywhere.",
        "Secondly, the problem with the inaccessible building must be solved. Historic sites such as the city walls will be made wheelchair friendly and handrails and special paving stores will be installed for people with visibility problems or other mobility issues.",
        "Finally, equality and inclusion help shape everything in daily life. In my opinion, a special disability forum will help a lot to the people. As a result, they can review plans from architects before any new development is allowed to be built.",
        "I hope you will consider my suggestions and I look forward to hearing from you."
