        "Furthermore, I would like to state that I have a full-time job with a software firm and it keeps me busy on weekdays as well as on most of the weekends. Moreover, I am supposed to embark on a travel to England for a period of six months which makes it all the more impossible for me to attend the evening course for the mentioned period. However, I feel that the later half of the year is somewhat free and I would be able to stretch myself and make some time to attend the evening course. Nevertheless, I am planning to spend regularly on picking up the details of the course on my own which will ensure that I might blend in easily when I rejoin the course at a later point in time.",
