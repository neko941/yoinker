        "Recently, it is believed that the money allocated in technology development of space exploration is not justified and there are various better ways to spend this amount of money. Although this is quite reasonable, I partly disagree with the statement.",
        "To start with, most of them are not experts in this field, especially this abstract space exploration that very few people could understand and study it. Accordingly, these people cannot have such involved in this particular field due to their little knowledge about it. In fact, space learners must take around ten years of study and not all of them can participate in such important and exorbitant field of research so even if many people think that they can give advice that they think it is reasonable, it is actually not or even can be detrimental when scientists apply it.",
        "However, space scientists nowadays increased focus on finding planets to accommodate, for example on Mars or the Moon while it is actually better to think about other purposes. Two cases in point are weather forecast and climate change. Rather than spending an enormous amount of money on such aimless and not at the moment really feasible like out-of-planet living, building satellites for the weather forecast or focus on a meteorological study to address such grinding issues about climate change are much more reasonable.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that space corporations have been carrying out reasonable plans and have well managed the work for employers so all should trust these companies rather than complaining and giving more helpless advice. This has clearly shown why I partly disagree with the statement."
