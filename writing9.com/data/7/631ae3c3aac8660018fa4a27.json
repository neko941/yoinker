        "Let me describe my situation. My sister lives in Spain and she is preparing to get married soon. Her wedding day will clash with the dates of my presentation. It is super important for me to attend her wedding with my family and friends. She would be depressed if I did not attend her wedding and I do not want to make her sad on that special day. I hope you will consider my situation favorably.",
        "I have been working on my project for two months so far, and I am done with almost 80% of it. I expect that this thesis project would be beneficial for all our team members. I would like to change the presentation date from August, first to July, 18th to be able to present my project successfully.",
