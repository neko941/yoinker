        "Some people opine that home schooling is best for an infant's progress. However, others think that it is essential for them to attend school. This essay discusses the advantages of both ways and it will also state my opinion.",
        "On one hand, teaching children at the residence may have some advantages such as privacy, convenient time schedule, and familiar atmosphere. That is, a youngster could learn and develop at their own place from their parents in a better way as they are comfortable in their room, and no one around causes any disturbance. Moreover, Students could get enough sleep as they will not have to wake up early to commute to school. For example, many children who cannot afford to pay academy fees rely on home tutoring. As a result, it is a famous opinion that home education is vital for a child's development.",
        "On the other hand, educational institutions have been showing incredible progress  since generations. Some benefits from this includes better resources, practical lessons and increasing adaptability.  I mean to say that centre of learning is a place where an adolescent evolves because of the efforts taken by their certified teachers. Face-to-face lectures help children to communicate better. Interaction with other children also helps them to become more practical and adaptable, which will benefit them in future. For example, nowadays international schools have reached a high level where a teenager is moulded to their extreme best.",
        "In my opinion, I strongly believe that a minor must take education from an institution which possess certified instructors in order to achieve success in life. However, there is no harm to practice what is learnt in school later. This is the best way for a youth development.",
        "To conclude, it is still argued whether education should be remote or not  for a child's progress.  Both the cases have their advantages as cited above. In my view, an adolescent could be more benefited if they attend classes and receive knowledge from reliable sources."
