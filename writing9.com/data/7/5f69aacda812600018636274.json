        "Traffic congestion has become a burned issue in this modern era and it is said that higher tax should be imposed to halt this obstacle. I think it is an unfair decision and I will discuss it's positive and negative sides in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, one benefit of this solution is that people would consider less about private vehicles as it would be exceedingly expensive if they use their car instead of public vehicles. Moreover, this measure would encourage individuals to commute on the bus and the train. Also, environment problems would be reduced if this act is passed by the government and people will not face any hazard if private vehicle's number is decreased by this solution. In addition, tax revenue will spend on public transport, which requires a service to be renewed.",
        "On the negative side, imposing a tax on private vehicles could be difficult to pay for people who are under poverty and they have to use a car to reach their destination as   Countryside areas have no access to public transportation. Also, people are already paying a cost on their vehicles. A worker with fewer salaries will not be able to follow this quick fix than rich employees so it would be an unfair tax. However, further taxes would affect transit companies as they would earn less money if people avoid buying vehicles due to increasing tax.",
        "To conclusion, tax can decrease traffic congestion and make public transport popular, but it also leads to dispute. So this solution has pros and cons for the public."
