        "Nowadays, Education is increasing day by day in everyone's life. Few people believe that institute children should learn about food growing and making process with their lessons. This essay shall discuss this statement and last I will give my opinion.",
        "To begin with, Some people think that school children learn about food is much important as well as their other subjects. Firstly, the teacher can teach about the importance of food and also tell them how much time to take growing of plants. These kind of things spreads awareness to children about food plants and their grow time. For instance, As per survey, 70% of children are learning about food products, materials and making process in their school. In addition, it helps in their future. They know about how to cook and grow a plant in their home for natural crops. And it also help in their home for cooking.",
        "Moreover, If they learn about food in their school time so it can increase their cooking skill and they inspire for making a new different cuisine like, Chinese, Italian, Mexican and many more. In addition, In their spare time or an emergency time children can make their favourite dishes and fills their stomach. Furthermore, If these kind of skill is learned in school so children can do their best and they survive in another country or apart from home. For example, Most children depend on their parents for their daily meal but they learned about cook so it is support themselves.",
        "As per my opinion, Spread awareness and tech about cook it is more important and it is an essential skill. So after they have a knowledge about this thing and they can manage their own."
