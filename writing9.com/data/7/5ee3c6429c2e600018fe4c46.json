        "Nowadays, many parents give a little amount of money to their kids for their immediate needs. Some critics argue that these latest trends will help children in many ways. I firmly believe that giving pocket money to children in the younger age have some negative impacts as well.",
        "On the one hand, there are many parents, they care for their children by offering some pocket wage. They think that this smaller amount of wealth will help their children to learn the basics of money management. Subsequently, they can learn how to manage and spend money in the near future. Another benefit is that children can use this money for their study purpose and buying some useful gadgets. To give an ideal example, with the pocket money they can purchase the materials like a pen, textbook, i pad and so on. So these practices should help smaller kids become mature teenagers and adults.",
        "On the other hand, children may try to misuse this cash in different ways. They may tempt to buy and use illegal drugs like cigarette and alcohol with their friends. Consequently, they lose focus on their studies and exams. Sometimes, parents and teachers can not follow and watch what their children are doing. Besides,if they have cash with them, they may tend to purchase unnecessary things, which is not essential to them.",
        "To conclude, while it can be argued that too much emphasis is placed on giving a small amount of fund to children, my own opinion is that the parents should be careful before allowing their kids to handle money because they may try to misuse it."
