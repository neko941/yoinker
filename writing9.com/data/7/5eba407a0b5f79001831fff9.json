        "Nuclear weapons can be used for creating calmness in the world. Atomic power is much more affordable and less polluting source of energy. There are many advantages of nuclear power which exceeds its drawbacks. In my opinion, nuclear power is good for society as an energy source but it's not logical to use it for threatening the world for achieving peace. Let's talk about its advantages and disadvantages.",
        "Firstly, nuclear power is a good source for generating electricity as compared to hydro power at any given climate conditions, for instance,; hydro power cannot be used in the winter when everything froze but nuclear power never froze at any temperature. Secondly, generation of power through atomic power is less polluting as it constrains to one building and no one can go through it. Lastly, Nuclear power can replace all other non-renewable source of energy like petrochemicals, coal etc. Which will reduce the burden from these sources and will save the mankind.",
        "On the contrary, nuclear weapons shows a power in the world. The country which will have more weapons will rule other by dictating them and this is not the mean for world peace.  This will also lead to a war like situation for example, during World War 1, America had the atomic bomb attack in Japan just because Japan was against them in war.",
        "In the conclusion, nuclear power is a good source of energy which will reduce our dependence on non- renewable sources, but nuclear weapons are not good for mankind as they are built only to satisfy someone's ego."
