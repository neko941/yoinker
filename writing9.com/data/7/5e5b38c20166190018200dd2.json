FOR EXAMPLE, AS PER THE UK HEALTH DEPARTMENT SURVEY, 70% OF THE EUROPEAN USED TO LIVE MORE THAN 80 YEARS DUE TO THE HABIT OF EATING NUTRITIONAL ITEAMS AND CYCLING.",
        "ON THE OTHER SIDE, PEOPLE THINK SO BECAUSE, THEY FIND THE OTHER THINGS LIKE HAVINF NICE AND SUPPORTIVE FAMILY, FRIENDS, OR LOVED ONE'S MAKE LIVING MORE ENJOYABLE THAT AUTOMATICALLY WOULD RESULT IN THE GOOD HEALTH OF ALL THE MEMBER AND PEOPLE LIVE MORE.
