To illustrate, it deceives them only to push them towards buying even if they will not get the stated benefit. Secondly, the great number of advertisments leads the society to be a consuming society more than being a producing one. For instance, they alter people's mind towards following the latest trend and consume certain brands with high prices. Lastly, some advertisments influence children who put pressure on their parents to buy them things. This pressure is being out of parents' hands.",
        "In conclusion, advertisments are useful and necessary to push the industry and trade in the country forward. Adds has a lot of pros as well as cons as like as any other thing or facility that has not only positives but also negatives. The use of advertisments may be in the right or wrong way, according to the user and how he uses them."
