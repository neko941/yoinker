        "In this day and age, that children are adapting to changes in the globalization era leads to changes in eating habits and lifestyles, which are different from those of the previous generation. In response, some have said that it is such a negative trend as it has negative impacts on our health, which I totally agree with.",
        "Nowadays, there has been a growing trend that children are prone to eating junk foods which are sold in every corner of a city such as hamburgers and snacks. The foods sold are very unhygienic and poisonous which will lead to stomach sickness. Furthermore, those kinds of food are low in nutrition, high in fat and calories which creates obesity and malnutrition at a very early age. In the past, parents really cared about their children's habit of eating and they always prepared healthy dishes at home for their children to consume nutritious food which useful for their brain.",
        "Moreover, the way of living and addiction to modern technology has created a huge effect on children. Most children and teenagers, these days, are having a sedentary lifestyle. Instead of being engaged in physical activities, they spend most of their free time playing games and watching TV. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of children who encountered eye problems and backache at a very young age. In contrast, children in the past were much more active when spending more time on sports and cultural activities like dancing, singing and playing which made them very fit and could get more involved with their neighbors and society.",
        "All in all, it should be put in our attention that children's activities nowadays are different from several years ago. Parents should take it into consideration to encourage their children to participate in outdoor activities and change their eating habits by consuming more healthy and nutritious food."
