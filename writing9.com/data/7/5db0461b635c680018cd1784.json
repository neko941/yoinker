        "Some hold the opinion that movies are better watched in the comfort of your home, on tablets or phones, while others prefer to watch films in movie theatres to get the full experience. This essay agrees that movies are better watched on electronic devices at home.",
        "Cinemas are the perfect place to view films because of the picture and sound quality. This cannot be compared to small phone or tablet screens, therefore, films are enjoyed to the utmost on the big screen. For example, seeing movies like The Avengers in 3D theatres is best watched in cinemas because the full effect of the movie can be seen. For this reason, people opt to see movies in a cinema.",
        "Even though going to the cinema is a social excursion, it can be quite expensive. Movie tickets are not cheap, and this comes with the additional cost of snacks such as popcorn and cold drinks. For a middle-class family, that is a lot of money. In comparison, homemade popcorn and drinks come to more than one third of the cost at the cinemas. Therefore, staying at home to view on your electronic device is more favourable.",
        "In addition, many people find it more convenient to watch their program at home. There is no need to dress-up and you can pause the video at any point if you need the toilet. Instead of popcorn, people can opt for heavier meals. This is an another reason why people would choose to rather watch their videos at home.",
        "In conclusion, while some believe that films are better watched in a cinema, I, among others, believe it is more convenient if viewed online."
