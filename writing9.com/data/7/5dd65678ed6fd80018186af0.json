        "I Ms.Anughra Shah from block-c, room no.3.I am writing to inform you that I wish to move into new accommodation as I am finding it a bit difficult to get adjusted with the current roommates.",
        "To bring in your notice the other 2 girls with who I am sharing the room are very noisy, they always tend to have late-night parties with heavy music on. It makes a disturbing atmosphere during my sleep hours. Additionally, they have a habit of using common bathrooms for long hours which ultimately makes me always late for the first lecture. Many times, I made cordial requests however, It seems they are not at all willing to maintain silence nor help me during an emergency. I request to look out some other option where the roommates are friendly supportive and understanding. It will help me a lot to concentrate on studies while the exams are nearby.",
        "I humbly request you to consider me on priority and find an alternative for my current stay. I look forward to hearing back from you immediately.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
