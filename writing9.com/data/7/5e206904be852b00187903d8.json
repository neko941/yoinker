        "Nowadays, more often than not, people tend to make purchases without compromising their choices; hence, a similar range of products are widely available among almost all countries across the globe, leading them to become an identical marketplace. In my opinion, this trend is highly advantageous as it does not only offer variety, but also cost-effectiveness.",
        "The cogent reason why the concept of the globalized market is significant because it can serve a variety of product. Whenever a customer plan to buy anything, they can easily compare both international and domestic items, enabling them to attain the best commodity out of their spend. For example, I bought a laptop bag, since it was an Indian brand, after comparing it with the available native products in Dubai last year. Thus, as long as customers are willing to explore buying option for a particular product, having a wide range in the regional market is certainly helpful.",
        "Furthermore, this trend is often proved an incredibly economical way of shopping. As more retailers lead in the market to sell their product, make it a competitive situation, it becomes a lot cheaper for any customer to but any item. To Illustrate, since an Australian sports brand has opened a store in our area, they have acquired the market share by 5% because they offer cheap deals. Therefore, as long as a competitive pricing is crucial, a concept of global market is the key to achieve it.",
        "To conclude, different countries are developing as a mirror image of each other, enabling people to buy the same product in almost everywhere in the world. This essay explained how similar marketplace can offer a range of product and cheaper option to buy from. I believe that this is an entirely positive development because it provides a liberty and less costly way of shopping."
