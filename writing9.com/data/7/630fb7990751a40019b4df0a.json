        "Dear Alex,",
        "I am about to go to Toronto where I was recently offered a new job and would like to request your help with finding a place to live.",
        "I checked out a few web platforms and there were some options that looked attractive, but none of them were affordable so I decided to ask a local for assistance. I heard that you had some friends who were real estate agents and who might have shared their expertise with you.",
        "Speaking about what I'm looking for: first of all, it must be within a twenty minute drive from the airport, as that's where my new workplace is going to be. One of the parks must be in proximity as well, it is necessary for my morning runs. If there are no nightclubs around, it's great. Then, I don't mind it being a private house, but it could be overly costly so an apartment in a block is just fine. But in that case, I'd still like to have a window view not on another block or parking, that makes me depressed. Finally, I will need at least two bedrooms \u2013\u00a0my kids prefer a separate one.",
