        "It is still controversial that at what age, children should start to receive formal training. Some people suggest that early year education will be advocated; while, others support that school discipline should be started no younger than 7 years old. The essay will discuss both views and my personal opinion that I opine the latter.",
        "",
        "To begin with, people advocate that early year training will benefit children because they are so\u00a0\u00a0innocent just like a piece of blank paper that\u00a0\u00a0it is easy to teach them,\u00a0shape their\u00a0\u00a0attitudes and nurture better habits for their future lives. Moreover, early year schooling may benefit the children's development and enhance their cognitive capacities as well because their brains remain in the process of growing.\u00a0Some researches indicate that children who enrolled in kindergartens and received a formal early year schooling did better in their later career paths.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, some inhabitants advocate that formal discipline should be carried out when\u00a0children are 7\u00a0years old or older because this kind of education require children's cooperation and commitment. Only children older than 7 years have developed capacity to follow commands and self-control during classes. Besides, formal discipline may make students feel restricted, which\u00a0may discourage students' interests\u00a0in learning. For younger children, it is tough for them to sit still for 45 minutes to listen teachers' lecturing. Therefore, going to school after 7 years old will help more children.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, I personally support that children may\u00a0benefit more if they enrol in\u00a0school at an older age like older than 7 years old due to the above reasons. In addition, early year childhood is the most precious period for children enjoying their time happily and growing freely. School discipline for children who are 7 years old or older may contribute to their better development in their further academic training and future careers."
