        "Soaring competition also encourages many adults to seek excellence in more than one area. Job security is no longer available in many sectors. People may lose their job anytime and to protect themselves against such catastrophic scenarios, they are working two or three jobs. For example, layoffs  in multinational companies have become very common these days. No one wants to take chances with their financial security and stability.",
        "The availability of more opportunities also motivates many enthusiasts to adopt multiple careers. Thanks to the advent of the internet and telecommuting, people now have the option of working from anywhere. This enables them to freelance without quitting their full time job.",
        "In conclusion, ambition and the lack of job security are the factors that drive people to pursue multiple careers. The availability of new opportunities just made this easier for them."
