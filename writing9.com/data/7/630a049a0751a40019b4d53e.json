        "In the cutting - age , everyone has a busy timetable so they cannot take out the time for their own lives and also they do  a job under pressure. Sometimes people argue that they cannot do work with  stress and this essay explains problems and gives solutions to this statement.",
        "First of all , people should do less than one profession because if they work more than that , they will invite frustration , worry and other mental diseases , for instance , a number of famous motivation speakers say that we should focus only on our aims , consequently , they will get flooded bucks rather than a job. Furthermore , numerous people are running for the capital which is the reason they cannot live their life in the proper way   , such as , many businessmen do not leave their chairs, due to the temptation, therefore spending their later life stressful.",
        "On the other hand , companies should provide discounts on the workload , which can help them to reduce  stress during  commercial work , for example , a number of prestigious companies give time off to employees from the work , consequently , it will increase the work speed and they will get better performance rather than in the  past. Moreover , every month should organize programs for companies , where they must respect the action person that impacts others and try to do more work , for example , many companies organize an annual function , where they provide awards to workers , who give their hard for the industry.",
        "In conclusion , many industries should take care of them , Which can help them to decrease the rate of employee migration , in addition , they will increase rapidly income of factory."
