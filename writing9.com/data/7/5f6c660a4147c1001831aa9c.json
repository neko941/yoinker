        "There is no doubt that many countries over the world do not provide free scholarship facilities for people who can not afford it, despite this everyone should have equal rights to access education. In my opinion, I completely agree with the idea that education ought to be free because it can benefit both society and individuals.",
        "The first reason why I am in a favour of free tuition in all kinds of schooling forms is that more educated people can help a nation to develop and prosper. That is to say, providing permission to people who are not able to afford their offspring tuition fees can create a great chance for all children or adults to access different types of education services,  and it causes to increase significantly many intelligent citizens over the country. To illustrate, those youngsters who graduated from education centres with high qualifications can serve to society in important positions, and the government will not need to hire employees from overseas.",
        "Another point to consider is that free education can reduce crime rates in societies. In other words, schools can organize more interesting and involving extracurricular activities for children to reduce per-pressure and encourage them to abandon gangs, which have an adverse influence on young people. For example, many criminals are prone to commit crimes from an early age, however, a free schooling system can help them to grow up as educated folks in the community.",
        "In conclusion, I strongly believe that free schooling in countries should be given because it helps to reduce the poverty of the nation and many crimes in societies."
