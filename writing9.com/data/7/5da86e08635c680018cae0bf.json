        "I am writing to you regarding the microwave that I purchased on 16th October, 2019 from your department stores at Utako branch which is not functioning. This equipment cannot be used because the start button is stiff. Consequently, I cannot power it on despite the fact that the plug is functioning.",
        "In order to rectify this issue, I called the help lines which I saw on the receipt and Mr. Pedro advised me on what to do. The first step was to send a snapshot of the receipt that was issued to me after a successful purchase. Furthermore, he also advised me to send a complaint letter to this email: [email\u00a0protected] for verification. Unfortunately, they neither responded to my complaint mail, nor resolved the issue, despite the fact that I followed his instruction,",
        "However, I would appreciate it if you would give me a new replacement since I have not used the product. Besides that, I believe I am entitled to this because the warranty policy said complaint must be made within 3 days of purchase.",
        "Thank you for your time while I await a positive feedback from you.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
