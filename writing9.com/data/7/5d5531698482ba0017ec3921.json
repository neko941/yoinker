People work extra hours to impress their superiors in order to get the better end of year appraisal and earn more to support their families. For example, the number of hours an average worker gives to their employer is 60 per week in the United States.

        "Limiting maximum of working hours and increasing minimum wage are both critical to mitigating work-life balance. People need to realize that if they live only for work, they will stress themselves both mentally and physically. Governments should also recognize the problem and increase hourly compensation. To exemplify, most employees burn out from working too much and neglect their families, friends, and other hobbies. Therefore, in order to improve balance between professional and personal life, one must maintain a better ratio of labour time and the authorities should compensate employers better.",

This essay discussed the two main reasons for this being increased job pressure and low stipend. It also suggested the solutions to these problems are twofold: limited work hours and increased salary."
