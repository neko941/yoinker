        "These days, it is becoming increasingly worrisome, as many skilled people have to contend for jobs that are supposedly designed for graduates. There are two main problems caused by this occurrence, as well as two possible solutions that could be taken to solve this problem.",
        "The most obvious problem would be insufficient jobs for people in junior positions. This means that people with little previous work experience or less skilful workers would be disadvantaged in this circumstance. If people with rich work experience apply for the same post as amateurs, it results in the latter having slim chances of getting the jobs. The direct consequence would be a considerable proportion of young people becoming unemployed. Furthermore, the expanding unemployed younger population would become a huge challenge not only for individuals but also for society. For instance, jobless youngsters would face various financial difficulties: not being able to become independent; difficulty in starting, raising, or proving for a family; and struggling to find a position with enough income to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Besides, young workforce joblessness would be a waste of human resources, and would likely cause a massive social crisis, as it would spark anti-social behavioural issues.",
        "Turning to possible solutions, several remedies are possible. Firstly, the main focus on problem-solving would be to create more work opportunities for people, both less skilled and higher-skilled, which will, in turn, release the pressure for young people. Secondly, the government should encourage the education department to develop various career pathways for graduates, such as: apprenticeships, on the business training, and training certificates, so that people at both skill ends could have more career opportunities.",
        "Overall, the problems caused by people that compete for the same jobs as young graduates are unemployment, and negative impacts on their families and societies. The solutions would be creating more jobs and various forms of career paths, so that people can go on with their lives and live in a prosperous and safe environment."
