        "The environment is one of the aesthetic features of  nature. Nowadays, most pupils are loving to spend their leisure time  travelling to enjoy the beauty of  nature. In this essay, we will discuss both advantages and disadvantages to travel to  remote natural environments and let's see whether the advantages will overweight the disadvantages or not.",
        "On the one side, It is great to explore things by travelling around the world. Nowadays, most people like tourists and scientists are travelling more to enjoy  nature and to explore the world. By travelling, people will gain more knowledge about that place, etc. For example, Many tourists travel to India and then they will get to know about the traditions, languages, etc of India.",
        "On the other side, When people travel to the wild then it will be harmful to both humans and animals in any way. For instance, When people throw waste in the wild then it will be eaten by animals which will be dangerous for their health. When there is a rapid increase in tourists then there will be pollution. For example, Shimla is one of the most famous and beautiful places in Himachal Pradesh but people throw waste on the roads which leads to pollution of the environment. When more people visit then there will more waste which will lead to high pollution in that area.",
        "In conclusion, It is better to travel and enjoy  nature but people should follow some rules and regulations to protect the nature and environment."
