For instance, a study conducted on teenage love by a leading University in London revealed that virtual relationships are on a surge and individuals who get broken up also are gradually increasing  and the chief cause is pointed out to be the internet.",
        "In conclusion, it is made clear that the actual friendship and relationships among people are affected  by modern technologies as were means of reducing actual bonds and inducing manipulation which results in fake perspectives as a major drawback."
