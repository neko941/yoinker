To what extent do you agree with this opinion and what measures can you recommend reducing this problem?",

        "In this 21st Century, to protect the environment, is our uppermost responsibility. Since last few decades, most of the human beings have started being lethargic about keeping their country neat and clean. I certainly believe that, people should be cautious about their surroundings as well as will be discussed steps to be taken to keep the area tidy.",
        "To start with, nowadays with a sedentary lifestyle, most of the mankind has started taking things too casually. Technology has made them too lazy. People are throwing away litter here and there without keeping in mind that, it will be harmful to their own family and colleagues. This carelessness is not only affecting their own life, but also the other habitat is coming to extinct. To illustrate, while we are throwing away the plastics, animals roaming on the street eat those plastics, which has caused the dire consequences of a death. Not only we are damaging the living beings on the earth, but also sea habitat is suffering. We are unbalancing the life cycle of whole habitat. Due to rubbish thrown away on the road, not only causing air pollution, but also causing global warming.",
        "However, public as well as government should come up with several campaigns and awareness program to tackle disposing of the waste problems. In my country, our prime minister comes up with \"clean India\" campaign. Due to which most of the citizens felt the necessity of keeping their public places free from plastics. Communities should come up with the charges, if anyone throws the garbages will have to pay the penalty.",
        "To sum up, being a socially responsible citizen of the country, it is in our hands to keep the future generation free from the pollution and provide them with the pure environment as well as safeguard the other living creatures on the earth."
