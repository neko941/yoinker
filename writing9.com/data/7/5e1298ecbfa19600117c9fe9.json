Unfortunately, the item I ordered was broken in its case and its flushed the entire carton. I couldn't use the product since it was poorly packed. I got twenty spatulas and one cleaning oil with the package which was also spoiled because of the cream that spilled on it. I was totally disappointed by seeing that. I cannot believe your company with these many years of reputation is actually not caring about your customer's and their products.",
        "Since I cannot use it at any cost I am going to return my product. I am not looking for an exchange in return. All I want is the return of my money into my account at the earliest. I am sorry to say that I totally lost my trust with your agency. I would suggest you to take an extra care in your company's packaging section. Because we, the customers are trusting you blindly when we order something from your site. Please don't break that contract.",
