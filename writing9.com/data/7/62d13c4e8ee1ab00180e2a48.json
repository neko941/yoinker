        "It is a commonly known fact that a high quantity of the currently produced food and beverages contains an extremely important amount of carbohydrate, which is proved to be bad for the well-being of human beings especially if consumed in high quantities. I personally am of the opinion that increasing the price of these products could lead to a lot of benefits both for the health of people and for the funds of a country.",
        "Firstly, drinks and foodstuff which contain what is considered \"bad sugars\", usually make people's weight increase to a point where they become obese. For instance, a statistic coming from the United States Department of Health, says that more than 40% of the current American population is overweight. The Federal Government recently passed a law that imposes a new tax that made all the sugary beverages such as Coca-Cola, Fanta, or Pepsi, slightly increase their prices.",
        "Hopefully, this decision will help the United States correct one of the biggest health issues it has been facing since the 1960s.",
        "From a solution like the previously explained one, comes also other benefits, indeed an expense on carbohydrate beverages and food will make a country earns more money that can later be redistributed to the population. It is possible to say for example that the amount of money a state could retrieve from a \"sugar tax\" can be enough to finance measures aimed at poorer low-income families that will help them save more money or to build infrastructures such as bridges or railways.",
        "Therefore, a sugar tariff can produce wealth that can help improve the public services used by every citizen in a country.",
        "To conclude, increasing the price of sugary foodstuff and drinks is a good idea to improve the population's quality of life by preserving its wealth and providing more public services and it will definitely make people think twice before buying such a threat to their well-being."
