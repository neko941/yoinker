        "Economic improvement is thought of as the only way to estimate a country\u2019s success. Nevertheless, there are other factors should be considered, such as social welfare, the well-being of individuals and the educational level of people. In this essay, I am going to talk about these factors and the reasons why I view happiness as the most critical consideration.",
        "At first, there will be some drawbacks and biases if we only judge a nation\u2019s success by its wealth. The definition of a prospering country includes good social welfare, a low crime rate and people-oriented public facilities, which lead to happiness for people living in the country. For example, China has grown significantly in its economy. However, low life quality, the massive wealth gap and political oppression make its civilians have low well-being. As a result, China is not considered  a successful country globally.",
        "On the other hand, a successful authority should make the nation become a better place where attracts people to live. The more satisfied the folks feel the more prosperous the country is. Take Finland for instance, according to World Happiness Report, Finland has been ranked first for several years on the happiness countries list. In the country, children are able to learn and enjoy their childhood completely. For adults, intact social benefits always help them to get through difficulties. With subsidies, the elderly people do not have to worry about their rest lives after retiring. Not only do a lot of nations try to imitate their politics but more and more immigrants are appealed to move there. Therefore, Finland has been seen as an advanced and developed country by international communities.",
        "In conclusion, how much fortune a country can earn is not the most critical factor when considering a successful country. Instead, civilians\u2019 happiness is the paramount element."
