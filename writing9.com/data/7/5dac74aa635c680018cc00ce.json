        "Dear Mr Huston,",
        "I am writing to inform you about my decision to discontinue my course at the university in the interim. Having to combine the school activities with my job at the National stadium  is beginning to take a toll on me because I am unable to concentrate on either of them. Due to the time strain, my course attendance has been poor, my mid-semester assessments was not impressive and  have also received a number of warning notices from my boss as a result of some laxities at work.",
        "Since my new posting to the fitness center of the stadium, my evenings have become busier and my work schedule now clashes  with my lecture timetable. With the new schedule, I would be missing alot of classes and will find it difficult to meet up with the minimum attendance required for my course. This will affect my grades and ultimately ruin my chance of applying for the student aid at the end of my sophomore year.",
        "I would like to defer my admission till the next session when I would be fully ready to face my studies with the least distraction. I will be switching to a more flexible job which will require me to work only five hours in the morning. With thus arrangement, I will have more time to focus on my studies in the evening and attend lectures without fail. Thank you for your understanding.",
