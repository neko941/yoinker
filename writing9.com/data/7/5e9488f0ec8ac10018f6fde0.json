        "A technological improvement over the past few decades has altered the way people communicate with  each  other.  Communication  over  a  long  distance and  instant communication  wherever someone is, has  definitely  been a big advantage  of  this improvement. In  this  essay  I  will  examine  how  relationships  have  been  affected  by technology,   and   then   I   will   assess   whether   it   is   a   beneficial   or   detrimental development.",
        "Communication at a distance between people from different countries has  made  communication  easier  by  different  apps.  For  example,  FaceTime  allows kids  studying  overseas  to communicate  with  each  other, despite  the  distance separating  them.  This  has  actually  encouraged  parents  to  chat  more  with  their children, as  it  is  easy  and  convenient  for  communication.  Nevertheless,  sometimes, when you are on the street and there is an emergency due to which someone needs to find you, a phones provides a good medium to do so, as they can just text and call you via different apps, like WhatsApp. This allows people to communicate in a more speedy and convenient manner.",
        "However,  due  to  the  development  of  phones  and  other devices,  people have started to  spend  more  time \u2018communicating\u2019 with their phones. For example, you  can  actually  observe  that  when  a  family  come  together  for  a  meal,  you  can probably find the teenagers looking at, and playing with their phones. Face-to-face contact is gradually becoming less usual, as people are no longer willing to talk to others in person, but spend more  time facing their phones.",
        "In  conclusion,  interaction has  made  easier  and  more  convenient  due  to  the development  of  technology,  like  phones.  However,  it  is  also  because  of  this, that people are spending less time talking to others face-to-face. Despite this drawback, technology generally has  had positive  impacts on the  way  we  communicate  over the  past  few  decades.  Therefore,  it  has had  a positive  impact on  communication due to its convenience and ease."
