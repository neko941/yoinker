        "Today, many countries struggling with various health problems as a result of eating too much fast food. Therefore, some people argue that, it is necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on these foods. I strongly agree with this statement, it is an important have tax for fast food to minimise health related issues and following this essay could express as follows.",
        "Firstly, it can be said that, eating too much fast food is not good for a good health. Since in the last five decades there had a growing trend towards fast food and many people were addicted to these foods. Due to its unique taste and variety of prices had captured many people around the world and many people have become too lazy to prepare homemade meals. Thus, people are now too interested towards fast food instead home cooked meals. The negative impact of fast foods can be very dangerous when eating too much and longer run it will lead to many health problems such as cholesterol, high blood pressure and much more.",
        "Secondly, nowadays,many people have been going through with weight related problems. This happens, when people are eating too much fast food. Again, this will be threatening to health. On the other hand, people have very less time to look after their health and people are avoiding the healthy diet and exercise.",
        "To conclude this, it can be said that, consuming too much fast foods can be harmful to a any person and in the longest time, it will lead to various health problems if people are avoiding to take care of their self with proper diet plan. I believe that, regular exercise is also necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle."
