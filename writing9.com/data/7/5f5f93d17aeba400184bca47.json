        "Unequivocally, in the contemporary era, media prefers to publish sad and negative news instead of reporting inventions and informative news. I opine that this kind of trend has detrimental effects on people as wells as on nation and in the following passages, I will fortify my opinion by a plethora of arguments.",
        "To begin with, the foremost impact of violent news is on the mental health of the citizens. If news channels will only show the news related to accidents, robberies and so on, the people would be scared and would feel insecure in the country and society they are living in. For instance, nowadays, many people restrict their girls to go outside alone after watching rape news on televisions. Thus, media depict the current scenario of the situation and environment around us and should also report the achievements of our cops and development of a security system in the country.",
        "Moreover,",
        "another undeniable effect of not reporting positive news is the lack of awareness and knowledge about the world. The young people will be deprived of knowing about the developments and career opportunities they can grab for their better future. What is more, apart from getting appropriate jobs, the individuals will be misleading to do crimes and other unethical activities to earn money.",
        "To conclude, I reiterate that there are humongous harmful effects of negative reports of media and they should change this trend on a war footing. The news related to developments of the nation and world should also be communicated to people which is essential for their growth."
