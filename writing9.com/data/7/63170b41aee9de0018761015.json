        "Some people believe art is essential, while others think it is not. I agree that art is critical, and this essay will explain why.",
        "Art plays a vital role in many aspects of people's lives. Most artistic works are highly ornamental, and people would like to appreciate them. People will feel a sense of pleasure when they view the desired results. It can make them forget the sadness and lift spirits, which gives people good mental health. Moreover, art also plays a crucial role in education. Studying is boring for students; if they only study major subjects, for instance, math, physics and chemistry, they will feel tired and not be motivated to explore further. If students learn art lessons while learning the main course, it will boost students' study. For instance, music allows them to relax, and painting can play to their creativity. Finally, it makes students learn in a better state and have a better academic performance in school.",
        "Otherwise, art is an excellent way to show history to the public. Artistic works come from various times, representing the popular trend and recording the local customs at that time. When we watch the works of art, we also understand the historical information at that time. Furthermore, people view the local artistic achievements, which will give them a better understanding of domestic culture and history. As a result, it will increase people's sense of national and national identity, making society more harmonious.",
        "To sum up, art significantly impacts people's lives, and there is no doubt that art is essential."
