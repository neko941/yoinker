        "Unemployment has become a major issue in most developing countries. By in large, youth is struggling due to a lack of employment opportunities. In this essay, I want to cover all of the causes of this disappointment phenomenon which has paramount importance and recommended some solutions.",
        "There are numerous causes of minute job vacancies in poor countries. Firstly, If the country is suffering from a financial crisis on a large scale, more likely, that the unemployment rate will be higher without a doubt. For example, for over a decade, in Asia, young are struggling to find a job after finishing their graduation and master\u2019s degree. Moreover, their condition depleted their people\u2019s hope. However, on a large scale, people are migrating to other countries for sake of better career and job prospects. Secondly, a low literacy rate plays a huge role in unemployment in humanity. However, there could be several reasons for this event, for instance, the population is a humongous role to play in any country. Furthermore, if we look through the figures in Asia, take an example in India or other native countries which is the second-highest populated country in the world and has a tremendous lack of job opportunities there. Youngs are straining there not only for a job but also to get admission into the university, for the main reason that there is a massive competition to embark on this opportunity. So, in case of that, the people could not able to survive if they do not move to any other country, their survival chance is very low.",
        "On the other hand, it is a crucial issue and humans can not ignore or take it easy. Government must pay attention to these circumstances because youths are the backbone of any country and all over the world. Every state government are responsible for these issues. They must accost youngsters to go to university and allow them to have a master\u2019s degree. As we know the competition is high but they should treat everyone equally. In addition, youngsters also try to learn some extra curriculum like some other skills that make their life easier in case if they cannot have any study relative job. Instead of relying on a 9 to 5 job with these aspects, they can earn some extra money as well.",
        "In the nutshell, unemployment is a bigger concern because it gives birth to hunger or poverty. Even may increase the death rate as well, people are emerging in health problems like severe depression and other chronic diseases. So, there should be a concrete measurement to mitigate the detrimental effect it is having on the nation as a whole."
