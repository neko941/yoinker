        "Every family has their own history. I would agree that looking back and reflecting on the past history is has its uses, whilst others believe that the what is happening now and what is to come should have greater priority.",
        "Others would argue that instead of reflecting on what happened in the past, it is necessary that we look at what is happening now and what is too come. If  there is no focus on the current lineage, then issues could arise which could disrupt the family. For example, if parents are fully focused on their family tree, then they could start to neglect their children and their education. As a result, the child will struggle to cope and have problems in the future, which in turn would affect the future of the family.",
        "I believe that research into past relatives holds great significance. This is because there are various genetic disorders which can be inherited. For example, certain types of cancer are hereditary. Hence, through research into these past records, doctors are able to detect and provide instructions on how to prevent any occurrences of said diseases. Only through extensive research into the past medical records, will people be able to understand the risks for the future. Therefore, allowing the future generations to thrive in health.",
        "In conclusion, although many believe that the present and future generation should have greater priority, I believe that through investigations of past records will the present and future only be able to thrive."
