        "In the recent times, due to advancement in technology, world has become more digitalised. Therefore, it can be predicted that everyone would prefer to read digital copy of newspapers and books without any expense, so none of the individual will use printed materials. I bolster the notion to a major extent. My inclination is justified in the ensuing paragraphs.",
        "Out of all, the first and foremost reason I would bring is, advent in technology taking us on an unimaginable path to access information. In other words, there can be numerous platforms available for reading, which would be the blessings of the technological world. We will have apps, online websites to exhibit news in the form of audio and visuals and some wide screen could be available, which continuously flash the news. Moreover, this hectic schedule life may not offer individual enough time. Due to this, they do not have time to sit back and relax for waiting of newspaper. So, they prefer to get news they way, which will not handy and least time consuming. In these cases, printed materials in the form of pdf's and mobile clips, images would be more adopted.",
        "Furthermore, another contributing reason to support my view is, carrying the newspaper and books at every place is sometimes handy. Likewise, if an individual has to read newspaper, he has to carry all the way to the office or whenever he works or studying. So, rather than carrying material whole day, it would better read newspaper in digital form, which can be easily available through the websites or app installed in mobile. In addition, reading books and newspapers are older ways to get information, only older people would prefer this trend, while fast paced generation will not able to adopt this system.",
        "On the other hand, I will not overlook any benefits of physical copy, any readers state that the feel of reading through these physical materials could not compare with online materials. Also, if such trend continues, then it is detrimental for writers to earn money through writing books.",
        "To sum up the discussion, although, this phenomena of reading online newspaper and books may lead to some negligible disadvantages, but in this hectic life people would not prefer to read through printed copies. Also, handy to carry everywhere. Eventually,  it will be better to update with technology and adopt online trend of reading."
