        "In the past decade, there has been a huge rise in the number of smokers. People are opting this habit really quickly, some believe smoking to be stress buster and some just do it as a fashion trend. But whatsoever these people are choosing this habit out of their free will and they are well aware of the dangers involved with it. This has lead to an ongoing debate about whether smokers should pay extra for their medical treatment or not. Well, I agree that they should pay more. This essay will discuss some of the reasons for my agreement.",
        "Firstly, the most important factor for implementing expensive medical treatment for smokers is that by doing so some of them may quit smoking due to money issues. For instance, there are many people who do it just to show off, with an increase in hospitalization expenditures they will surely prefer to leave this fashion. Secondly, when smoking both active and passive smokers are getting affected. The active smoker is doing it intentionally, but the person standing next to him may not even like that. Thus, while smoking they are not only harming themselves, but also affecting other people.",
        "Another main reason is that smokers are adopting this habit at the cost of inheriting many linked diseases. If they are willing to accept all the disadvantages than they can also pay a little more. At the end, they will have to choose between the two. Lastly, by sparing some money from people who are intentionally accepting diseases, government can utilize it for the needy and poor who are innocents and deserve basic medical treatments.",
        "To conclude, if smokers choose smoking over hospital expenses, then that's their choice to make and they can also afford to pay high. But, if there are some who are willing to choose their health than government should provide them with cheap rehabilitation centres to help them."
