        "I am writing this letter to inform you that I received a letter from you last week notifying me to acknowledge the acceptance of a new bank card but surprisingly, I could not find the card in the envelope.",
        "I am worried that the card may fall out on its way to my home. Somebody might pick it up and misuse it for their benefit. Most importantly, I am concerned that it might be used for payments that are illegal. In such a situation, authorities might trace back to my bank account and I might be accused of these illegal activities.",
        "Therefore, I would like to request you block the missing card immediately to prevent possible negative consequences. The longer it takes to block the card, the more chances it will be misused. Furthermore, could you please send me a new card within this week? As I have to travel abroad on the coming weekend, I would really need to get it within this week.",
