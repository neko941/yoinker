        "Since the big bang multitudes of planets were created, but the only planet to sustain life so far in this vast universe is still the planet earth.Life was developed and perfected over millions of cycles of evolution to see the forms which we see today.Due to rapid destruction of living things this essay explores that environmental damage is a much more pressing concern than just the loss of one specific living form.",
        "On one hand,the fast pace of modernization is gobbling up the habitats of species and is destroying the natural balance needed to sustain a healthy ecosystem.For example the African mammoth,once a mighty elephant disappeared when it was massively hunted in Africa.This uncontrolled and unregulated hunting led to the complete annihilation of all the other microsystems, which were dependant on that animal.Thus the loss of a particular breed is an important indicator of the destruction.",
        "But on the other hand, if we take into view that rapid urbanization with its necessary evils like greatly increased the need of fossil fuels to derive mega energy projects is depleting the planet earth of its resources.This is creating the problems of global warming and is leading to climate change.Glacier caps are melting and water levels are rising everywhere.Thus, not just one particular progeny, but in fact all of beings are in danger of extinction if this problem is not dealt with quickly.",
        "In conclusion the loss of a specific living being is a big disadvantage, but there are more concerns which will eventually lead to much greater carnage.This is the need of the hour to ponder over the solutions to this dilemma.Let's hope sanity prevails before the last big man made extinction."
