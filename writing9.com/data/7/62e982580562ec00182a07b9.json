        "The time of digitalization has improved all aspects of human life. Especially the way we communicate with each other is not still the same as before, because innovative technologies give people an opportunity to reach somebody from everywhere in the world in a few seconds. But, while we are able to call or message somebody, the amount of personal meetings in our life is decreased. This essay will argue that the benefits of this new way of communication through the Internet or mobile phone offset the drawbacks entailed by this state of affairs.",
        "First of all, the possibility to communicate without personal contact saves people a lot of resources. For instance, their working time or money can be invested in further technology development instead of a travelling to formal meetings. Therefore, through the replacement of face-to-face conferences with internet calls or messaging all workers can reduce the consumption of natural sources needed for a journey.",
        "Furthermore, the Internet and mobile phones make it easy to have a friendship with somebody who lives in another country. Although there are many people who prefer to spend  time messaging or playing on a phone, real friendship couldn't be disturbed through this new way of communication, because best friends will never lose the opportunity to meet with each other.",
        "In conclusion, it is clear, that using the Internet and mobile phones is beneficial for  society and makes a significant contribution to the convenience of our daily life. On balance, I recommend everybody to invest his knowledge and time in innovation  because only all together we can improve our future."
