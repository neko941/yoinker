        "As you have always wanted to be an entrepreneur without gaining hands-on experience in the field of business administration, continuing with studies will not be a good idea. Needless to say, you\u2019ll never enjoy theoretical courses in an institution, unless you experience the practical business world. Getting professional work experience at this moment is a great idea. To start with, you will develop crucial interpersonal skills and a significant social network. That means choosing to work will be beneficial for your social and personal life and I am saying this from my own experience. As you know, I chose to continue my studies right after high school and regretted the boring routine almost every day.",
        "I\u2019d like you to work either in a contact center or as a sales person. These professions will not only polish your communication skills but also boost your confidence.",
