        "There is a contentious debate over whether longer jail sentence is the best solution to decline the rate of crime or there are other better measures. This essay will look at both sides of the argument, and then I will give my own perspective.",
        "On the one hand, people believe that the best way to decrease crime is pose stricter punishment like longer prison sentences. The main reason for believing this is because this phenomenon can create fear in the criminal\u2019s mind. It poses a threat to the offenders to lose their freedom, and lose their relatives a long period of time. Consequently, it plays a vital role in cautious consideration before committing crime.",
        "On the other hand, it is possible to say that there are better alternative measures to reduce crime. The culprits that contribute to this assertion are education and occupation. Main causes leading to commit crimes are lack of knowledge, skills, jobs and money. As a result, providing proper education facilities and employee opportunities can solve the issue far more effectively. For example, at school, the head master can launch some campaigns to scope widen knowledge about laws of students to avoid commit offends. Moreover, the government should reinforce jobs opportunities or vocational courses to support criminals after releasing from prison to avoid re-offenders.",
        "In conclusion, both sides of the argument have their own merits. However, on balance, I feel that education and employee chances are better solution to decline the percentage of crime because it makes a significant contribution to enhance awareness of people avoiding crime."
