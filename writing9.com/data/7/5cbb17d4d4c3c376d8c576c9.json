        "Dear Mr. Koto,",
        "I am a member at Gold gym, Ottawa branch since 15 days after I shifted to the apartment next to this premises. I am recruited in a nearby high school as a sports teacher. I was a regular client in your Azex branch before moving here. I am writing this letter to suggest a few alternations in this gym, which are inevitable from my point of view.",
        "Firstly, the prime issue is that people do not wipe the machines after using them for exercise. The sitting portion is often dirty due to perspiration. Due to which, it is inconvenient for other people to perform their activities. Furthermore, it has been observed by me that some members are habituated to leave wet towels on the seats inside the dressing room. This leaves bad odour in that specific area and becomes increasingly difficult to have a steam bath.",
        "However, I would like you to improve the situation by making strict written rules to discipline all the members. Also, one should be given a penalty if they disobey any of the regulations. This changes would not only be appreciated by me but it would be admired by many of us.",
        "I hope you can empathize with my situation and would take the necessary action required.",
        "Yours sincerely",
        "Kausha."
