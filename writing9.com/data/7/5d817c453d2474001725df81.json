        "In today's world, more people are inclined towards their career than family, which was not same few decades back. Making children in those times were considered a big issue and very important to lead a happy life. This mindset has changed to a huge extent. Although it still remains an important aspect, but it is not the only way to be successful. This essay would give valid reasons to support the advantages of planning children at a later age.",
        "To begin with, people who are educated and well established can take the responsibility of guiding their children sensibly and also provide the financial support to them. They have enough experience which could be useful for their offsprings to have an easy and comfortable livelihood. Unlike children who face day-to-day problems, including financial, health and social. They are the product of very irresponsible parents who did not think about the consequences of their wrong decision. These parents usually are in their 20's and are trying to achieve success in their career by spending long periods at work and almost no time with their family. On the other hand, a couple who plans to have children once they are settled do justice to them by striking a perfect work-life balance.",
        "Another benefit of pushing this decision is creating ample space and time for one's self to pursue the career they want. To add to this, let's take an example of a successful person, Steve Jobs, he became popular during 1970's when he with his business partner ruled the technology market for many decades. He had his first child in late 1990's when he had already achieved a mark which everyone today dreams of. It's about focus and determination which gets affected if there is a family who needs an equal attention, hence it becomes extremely difficult to succeed with so much to handle.",
        "To summarize, a child should not have a childhood full of worries,struggle and tensions because they were brought into this world by some irresponsible parent, instead they should cherish each and every moment of their life. Couples who are ready to enjoy parenthood and give their child a blissful life should be encouraged for taking a wise decision."
