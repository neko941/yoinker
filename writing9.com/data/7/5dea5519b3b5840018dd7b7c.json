        "Firstly, one of the vital benefits of it for young individuals is being sure what they want to study as a major.

They will easily be able to make some good decisions about their future. Moreover, someone who is self-knowledge might be more successful in business.",
        "Although it has a large number of advantages, it has some disadvantages as well.  One of the most important handicaps is starting a job one year later. If they spend their time exploring life, they will spend a year. It may be harmful to a young individual. For example, when a person goes to another country to enhance his or her foreign language, they will not be able to make money or start the major what they want to be an expert. What is more, they will spend their savings on surviving.",
