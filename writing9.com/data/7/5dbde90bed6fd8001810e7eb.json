        "I am writing to express my desires to work out of our company's headquarters in Copenhagen for the first six months of next year. I believe that this opportunity will help me learn the work practices and understand the work culture of the company better, thereby making me grow both personally and professionally.",
        "Since I am working in a team with colleagues from multiple locations, being in Copenhagen would not impact my work. I would be able to support the team remotely in a similar structure as I have been currently doing. The only challange I see is that Copenhagen is in a different time zone than New Delhi. However, to mitigate and to support the team in India the most, I can start my work-days early there.",
        "Would you kindly provide me the required approvals and help me in arranging this work agreement in the headquarters? This would be a great learning experience for me in my career and I would really appreciate if you could help me arrange it.",
        "Thank you for your consideration.",
