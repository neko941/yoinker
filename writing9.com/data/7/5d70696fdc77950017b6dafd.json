        "Researching family history is becoming popular with the people. Getting to know about the roots, is instilled by curiosity to learn about different cultures and regions from which their roots belong as well as disease patterns in the family which can be seen beneficial for their health as well as tourism.",
        "Curiosity is one of the main reasons for individuals to find out more about their family background. People are becoming more aware as they read about mass migrations of individuals immigrating to different countries, which generates questions about their background in their mind. Getting to know more about the background, encourages people to discover different cultures and places which promotes tourism. For instance, if a person has never visited a country before, he would have another reason to visit and to know more about the culture and the place and promotes tourism.",
        "Another reason for exploring the background is it helps them to discover the trends in the family tree. Some gifts, skills, and diseases are hereditary, which can be interesting for people to learn, how many others in their family shared these from previous generations. For example, in the case of diseases, some of these could be avoided by taking necessary precautions, which can improve the living condition.",
        "In conclusion, it can be advantageous for people to learn more about the family's background and origins. Not only they get to know more about the skills, and patterns in the tree, but also it encourages people to discover new places."
