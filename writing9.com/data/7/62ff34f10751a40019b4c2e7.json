        "It is common that adults to encourage their children to achieve their goals by exerting full efforts, which makes sense because no pain no gain, while some argue that endeavour is not the only factor in success. For my part, I side with the opponents that the demerits of this behaviour surpass the merits.",
        "For one thing, there is no target that you can meet without working hard. To be specific, during the process of growing up, children basically totally rely on their parents to get what they want, and that's the reason why it is necessary for them to learn to exert their own efforts to earn things. Moreover, the most important lesson for today's young generation is about suffering hardship because the material-enrichment modern life is so convenient that kids can easily get what they want and be spoiled.",
        "For another, success is the combination of various factors besides making efforts. For instance, patience, carefulness and courage are also precious qualities to get things done, which kids need to acquire. Otherwise, children can get frustrated and feel unfair when they find out that even if they try their best they still could fail. Having the knowledge of the complexity and uncertainty of achievement can help immature minors build a proper attitude to face their failure.",
        "To sum it up, it is crucial for kids to learn the importance of endeavour and become hard-working adults, but I myself hold a firm belief that minors should also be aware that they still need other qualities to attain their goals."
