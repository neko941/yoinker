        "Foreign languages offer a great scope in one\u2019s career development. Hence, the majority of the schools have tried to incorporate foreign languages in the syllabi of students, however, the level at which such languages should be introduced is highly debatable. Although studying a new language at primary school instead of the secondary can pressurize the students at an early age, the advantages arising out of it outnumber the disadvantages.",
        "To begin with the cons, it can be said that children at primary school are often fulfilled with their studies, hence, adding a new course of languages to their curriculum can be challenging for them. Moreover, a new subject would involve self-study, home assignments and classroom assessments which can significantly occupy their leisure time or time which can be spent on physical activities.",
        "On the other hand, children who aim to be multi-lingual at an early age tend to have an advantageous edge over others. It is seen that in primary schools, children are less burdened with studies as compared to students of secondary schools. Therefore, it can be a great start for the children who are enthusiastic about languages and consider it as a career option. Furthermore, it is an established fact that younger children have more grasping power as compare to adolescents, hence, learning a new language can be a cakewalk for most of the children.",
        "To summarise, children are better off in primary schools where they are given exposure to foreign languages as benefits clearly outweigh cons. Therefore, schools must consider an early start of foreign languages and ensure maximum participation of every child."
