        "According to some people kids can be best guided by parents to be productive members of society others are of the opinion that educational institutes are better place to acquire this skill.  In my opinion, home is the best place for upbringing of children and improving their moral values.",
        "Some people argue and I agree that initially brought by children at home plays a vital role in making them good human beings who could be beneficial for the society. As is famous that mother`s lap is first school of child and the lessons learnt here can never be forgotten. In other words, the moral values taught by the mother stays with kids forever. Another point to consider is that parents read and understand the psyche of their children far better than the teachers. Hence, they can communicate far better with their kids and teach them the life subjects which prompts children to contribute effectively towards betterment of the neighbourhood.",
        "On the other hand,  some people have the notion that schools which teaches the pupils the practical aspects of life can play a better role in enhancing the capabilities of child as positive members of society. They believe that in educational institutions' students' social interaction with their class fellows can be a useful teaching tool.  The teachers can be excellent guides in this aspect, for instance, while settling conflicts between two students in the classroom. The teachers verdict in this case will be of vital importance, reward for humane kids and punishment for otherwise. In addition, children can receive practical demonstrations at school via stage dramas or role playing. This can play an enormous role in positively upbringing of child.",
        "In conclusion, the brought up of children at home plays an important role in making or breaking of child in the form of positive contributors of society or the other way round."
