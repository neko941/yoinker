        "Higher education provided by the institutions is a costly affair for some of the undergraduates. The most suggested proposals to amend this problem is to make the university teaching available to all at zero cost.

Consequently, it affects some fraction of the students adversely in a financial way.

I think even if the cost cannot be reduced to zero, it should be lowered to a level which is easily affordable by everyone. The minimal amount of money can aid aspirants to acquire quality studies, which can increase chances of having excellent professionals in future. If we have marvellous people working for society, it will enhance the economy, which in turn will ensure proper funding of colleges.",
