        "There are many people, in our contemporary society, who has decided to live in another country. In this context, it is argued by some people that there are unbelievable chances to fail in  this journey due to obstacle there is necessary to overcome. Other people claim the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. I strong tend to agree with the latter. From my own standpoint, to live abroad can be a rich experience and could assist people to grow personally and professionally.",
        "On the one hand, it is possible to analyse that there are several disadvantages to living in a different country. When it comes to language, it is an extremely difficult factor in living abroad. Most of the time to experience another culture has this challenge of facing a language which is different from your mother tongue. Another concern is related to the adaptation to a new culture and its costumes. To illustrate, people in certain nations wear different types of clothes, foods and habit are not the same.",
        "On the other hand, it is worth considering that to experience another culture could open your mind and expand horizons. Additionally, this opportunity could increase the quality of life and also security. For instance, a person who lives in a poor country and has the chance to move to a developed one could have greater education, to live in a safer place and later probably to find an excellent job.",
        "From my point of view, a wealthier country can provide to a foreign person an incredible chance of developing a remarkable career. As a result, individuals could have access to a better quality of life, such as education for their children, public health, and more.",
        "To sum up, as I see it, it is known that to live abroad is a huge challenge, especially in the beginning , but in the end the advantages overcome the disadvantages. However, it is necessary to be opened the advantages overcome the disadvantages. However, it is necessary to be open to this new world and to expand your mind to learn and live this new culture."
