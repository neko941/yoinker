Out of the plethora of restaurants spread across the town, this restaurant has always fascinated me to work for, as it is considered the best in the town. I consider myself aptly suitable for this position as primarily I have been graded with a food handling certificate. Moreover, my prior experience in working as a waiter for the past 4 years would guide me to provide the best services for the restaurant. Most importantly getting this job would quench this desire for working for this restaurant which I have been longing from a while.",
