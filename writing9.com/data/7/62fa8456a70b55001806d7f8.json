        "These days, language is considered  an opportunity to elevate human well-being. Some people believe that learning  linguistics in  native-speaking countries is the most effective way. In this essay, the reasons to support my agreement that travelling to foreign countries is a promising method to study  foreign linguistics will be presented in the following paragraphs.",
        "The first benefit of learning another language by living in the country is that students will learn the correct way to use it from the native speakers. For example, by learning English by travelling to England, they can get used to the accent and learn some slang words of English by learning with native teachers who use English as a mother language. Learning in an ordinary classroom cannot provide these types of skills from English classes tough by Thai teachers.",
        "Moreover, living in a place surrounded by foreigners is an efficient and fast way as it enforce you to listen, speak, read, and write in a particular language. Without using  particular linguistics, there is no other way to communicate with others. For example, my German friends can speak Thai fluently after living in Thailand for a year as they were surrounded by a crowd who cannot speak German and English. Therefore, they have to communicate with Thai people  every day. As the result, they use a very short time to learn Thai.",
        "Apart from learning a language, travelling to a foreign country can provide you with the opportunity to exchange the culture, tradition, and art of living in a particular nation, which will make you enjoy the culture and understand more about the background of the language resulting in better communication.",
        "In conclusion, according to the aforementioned reasons about the advantages of learning a foreign language by staying in the countries including being taught by a native speaker, surrounding by native citizens, and exchanging the culture, I strongly admit with the view that this is the most promising method to study new languages."
