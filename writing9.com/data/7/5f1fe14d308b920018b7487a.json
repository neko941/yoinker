        "In recent years, there have been immense advances of  TV and video games in most aspects of people\u2019s lives, especially in children\u2019s development. However, I would believe that spending too much time to watch TV and play video games could extent a negative impact on child\u2019s mental health.",
        "First of all, by binge-watching TV and playing video games most time, it makes kids could have no time for social interaction. In fact, mental health of child relies on a whole range of factors, including outdoor activities such as doing physical exercise and playing with other children which are essential for a healthy development. As a result, Spending a lot of time in front of a computer or TV screen limits a child time for such activities and makes them increasingly  isolated from the real world.",
        "Second and more importantly, though, younger children cannot concentrate for an extended time span without breaks. Watching TV or playing computer games for many hours can hurt their ability to concentrate on their homework or a book later on. Although, It is an undeniable fact that a number of  mind games or science programs allow kids to use their mind effectively to win the game, broaden horizons and improve their creative skills, they could not develop their mindset without concentrating ability. In other words, while TV programs and computer games are beneficial in the short term, its long-term effects are generally negative",
        "All things considered, there are many reasons why parents are well advised to monitor their children use of TV and computers closely. Especially younger children should be guided to spend their time in active and healthy ways."
