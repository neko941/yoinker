        "Hope all is well at your end. I received your letter a week ago seeking advice to get a job or go for higher studies. Since I know you personally, I prefer you to try to get a job which you are interested in. Since you aren\u2019t a big fan of studies and want to be a movie maker, I think you will not enjoy the post-graduation studies which are completely into research.",
        "I suggest you chase your goal of becoming a director as you have good direction skills which got you first prize in college level short film competition. I think it will be better if you start working as an assistant director so that you can sharpen your film making skills.",
        "Hence, I recommend you go through the moviezings.com which has the latest job postings related to the cinema field. Here you can find your relevant jobs such as assistant directors, short film contributors (freelancing), movie artists and so on. You should upload one of your previous short films after creating your profile and a detailed cover letter about kind of work you are looking for.",
        "All the best and I hope you will become a director soon.",
