        "Nowadays, As globalization has been connecting countries together, tourism has become the leading industry. Many countries are starting not only welcoming more tourists, but also providing many affordable services to attract more visitors. It is said that this trend has a huge benefit for the development of the economy, but I believe that the drawbacks are far more outweighed.",
        "On the first aspect of the matter, there are some reasons why national governments focus on developing of tourism. It is obvious to see that travel possibly boosts up the national economic background in terms of both the local populace. These particular actions are completely vital in economic contexts since local people could benefit from trading with travellers by selling their services such as handmade-crafts, which lead to improve their livelihood and also reduce the rate of unemployment. For example, Thailand is a country where has the flourishing tourism and become one of the top tourist attractions in South East Asia. As exempting visas for most countries, improving services, annually, it welcomes millions of visitors all around the world, and creating thousands of works for the citizens. Therefore, it could say that the development of the country is attached to travel.",
        "On the remained aspect, I would like to advocate that travel is the primary reason for the devastation of the environment. Every year, millions of tons of garbage wasted into natural, mostly from thoughtless travellers, are gradually damaging our natural environment. Nam Du island in Vietnam, for instance, used to be a pristine paradise. But now, it has become a \u201clandfill site\u201d since a large volume of tourists come to this yearly which makes the local authorities out of control. Thus, the more increasing travelling, the more destroying our nature.",
        "In conclusion, it is undeniable that the advantages of tourism and an indispensable part of the development of the country. But I have a belief that the government will soon realize how serious is the environment being destroyed by the travel industry and implement the right solution."
