        "In the modern society, people\u2019s work clothes have attracted much concern.Some people hold the view that the style of the staff should not be paid attention to by the manager on the grounds that the result is of importance. Personally, I believe the way they dress completely depends on the type of their company or job.",
        "On the one hand, formal clothes are suitable for professional jobs as well as in disciplined settings. Several certain jobs such as lawyer, doctor, teacher and even sales people require people dress up smartly and courteously which undoubtedly boost confidence and work efficiency.For example, when wearing white blouse in the hospital, doctors may be more aware of the value of their work in order to try their best to fulfil their duty. Furthermore, should they wear smart clothes, they will be respectful towards others, which affects social interaction and be enormously significant to those face-to-face jobs, especially marketing or receptionist.",
        "On the other hand, there are remarkable reasons why a multitude of individuals  hold the notion that using formal clothes is unnecessary. First of all, clothings are not reflective of the worker\u2019s own performance or their ability. For instance, technological companies like Google and Facebook are well-known for their relaxed dress codes because they aim to create an informal, exciting and creative environment; consequently, they produce sophisticated and convenient products despite casual clothes. Secondly, informal clothes are outstanding choices for not only sedentary work styles but also active employees. Loose clothes help relax their muscles, bring comfort and their actions will not be limited.",
        "In conclusion, although clothing does not reflex one\u2019s ability to work, the style of people should be appropriate for their jobs. While in the professional setting formal clothes increase people\u2019s self-confidence together with the work productivity and show respect to other people, casual clothes make the staff relaxed and also be convenient for moving employees."
