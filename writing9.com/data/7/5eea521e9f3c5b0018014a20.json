        "It is often argued whether happiness is the state of one's mind or it depends on other factors that include wealth, health, family, friends, and career. Although few people are extremely optimistic in bad circumstances, additional factors have a prominent role to play to make one's life happy.",
        "On the one hand, few people consider happiness a sole responsibility of an individual. This is because they have the perception that every person should have control over their emotions. However this is not possible for the majority of people, and I hold the other opinion that favours the need of external factors in maintaining one's happiness. To exemplify, 90% of the wealthiest people are finding more happy as compared to the poor and middle-class",
        "On the other hand, most people deem that external factors matter more in one's life. That is to say that everyone has some expectations such as a good family, big house, bank balance, and a Porsche car, and if not achieved, it can lead to disenchantment and dissatisfaction. In other words, fulfilling the dreams not only contributes to a sense of contentment, but also encourages people to earn more in order to satisfy their desires. Therefore, external factors play a significant role to make people remain happy in their lives, such as family support and money.",
        "To conclude, despite few people hold the opinion that happiness can be achieved by non-consideration of other factors, I believe that a person can never remain happy if things go wrong and against one's expectations."
