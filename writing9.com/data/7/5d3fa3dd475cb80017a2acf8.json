        "Increasing numbers of health issues are prevalent in young children in recent times. It is believed by some people that governments are liable to resolve this issue. I agree with\u00a0this belief to some extent as in my opinion, this situation is the responsibility of both the\u00a0government, the society and individuals.",
        "As the government is responsible for maintaining and improving the economic growth of its country, it must ensure steps in managing and enhancing the health of its youth.\u00a0Unhealthy children would mean an unhealthy future generation of a nation, which\u00a0would result in a slowdown of the economy as a whole. For example, an adult suffering\u00a0from diabetes at an early age would not be able to consistently work efficiently as he\u00a0would constantly suffer from lethargy and mental weakness.",
        "However, health management targeting children is also the duty of society and its individuals. Health issues among children would get worse with age and might result in\u00a0other severe diseases such as heart disorders and high blood pressure. These ailments\u00a0might then be passed through generations and create a pool of unhealthy individuals\u00a0in the community. As a result, parents as well as other adults need to instill the\u00a0importance of lifestyle and health management among young children in order to\u00a0equip them with long-term health consciousness. For instance, a family that follows a\u00a0healthy routine and fitness regime would cultivate these good habits in their offspring\u00a0and other kids, and prevent these young children succumbing to health problems.",
        "In conclusion, I agree to some extent that governments are responsible for solving the problem of unhealthy and overweight children. But, society and its individuals also\u00a0play a critical role in overcoming this situation."
