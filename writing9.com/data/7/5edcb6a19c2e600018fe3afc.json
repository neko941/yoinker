        "Nowadays, obesity began to be more common in young generation, with lack of exercise. The problem of this issue is the high number of fast food and video games, and the solution would be a balanced diet and daily exercise as well.",
        "One of the main reasons children are getting fatter and less fit is, because of the high number of fast foods they eat, and the endless hours spent in front of the TV.  Restaurants such as McDonalds, KFC or Burger King can be found in almost every corner with an extremely good merchandising, which leaves the mouth watering and it is not easy to avoid. Furthermore, video games became the main interest of almost every boy and girl, while the enquiry for any other sport is at a low rate. For example, the highest proportion of youngsters in my country spends their money on this kind of food because it is cheap and it is quicker than homemade food.",
        "However, a solution for this problem is developing a balanced diet, which is high in fibre, proteins and it consists mainly fresh vegetables and fruits. Parents should warn their children about the possible diseases fast food could create. I think that parents have the biggest influence on their child and they should take care of them. Moreover,besides the balanced diet, little ones should be sent to different centres where they can do sports, instead of laying on the sofa and playing video games. For example, they should go to swimming, playing basketball or even jogging.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that there are many risk factors which are leading to a bad lifestyle, but this can be avoided by a regular sport schedule and great diet."
