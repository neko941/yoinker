        "Nowadays, many people wish to live in a country which fulfil their future dreams. Some of them make a plane to leave, although, most keep it as a dream and don\u2019t try to leave their home. Those who seriously want to leave, have to find a justifying intent for the immigration officer, in order to, show their possible potential in the future of their government. Moving to a new place is a life changing decision that has to be carefully investigated. Possible advantage and disadvantage of leaving a familiar zone are as follows:",
        "There are many advantages of moving to a fresh environment, especially, when you leave a country that you have grown up in. The most promising advantage is that you go to a place that you really want to live there, thus, you will try your best for success beyond the current obstacles. A good example is Einstein who had left the Germany and started a new life in the United States of America. In addition, another reason that supports the hard working pressure of the immigration process is the differences between economical systems which include currency and salary rates. For instance, a programmer in Iran earns about $10,000 while the same job in Canada is paid more than $70,000 yearly.",
        "There are also some disadvantages that the most painful is by leaving you leave all your friends and many who are important for you. We all need to be surrounded by some who care about us and we feel comfortable in a good relationship with them. Moreover, moving to a new region means to start from the beginning for many immigrants. They not only need to learn a new culture, but also, they need to speak and communicate with a new language to join the society.",
        "However, there are many more advantages and disadvantage of leaving, I believe, when there are no differences between staying in the environment or moving to a new land it is better to leave."
