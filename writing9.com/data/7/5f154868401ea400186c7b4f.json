        "Nowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about whether establishing a healthy way of life in modern community would be accessible or an obstacle. Both views are true to some extents, but I strongly believe that the former is more rational because more and more residents have the intention to work out in a gym.",
        "To begin with, there are several reasons why people find tough to make their lifestyles more healthier in the current society. First of all, inhabitants have to deal with a mass of working assignment on a daily basis. Due to a 8-hour working time during the weekdays , the office workers would be unable to have enough time to relax as well as do exercise regularly, which effectively impact on their daily lives, resulting in a sedentary lifestyle in the community. The second reason is the omnipresence of junk food stores located in residential areas. People in the hectic whirlwind of daily activities are intended to consume a lot of ready-made food containing unhealthy chemicals, giving a rise to the high incidence of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, heart stroke and diabetes.",
        "Notwithstanding the aforementioned opinions, there are some justifiable reasons that people could control their styles of living healthily in contemporary society. Firstly, the majority of city dwellers are engrossed to hit the gym after heavy working time. It comes in the face of an increasing body of evidence that people would put aside their spare time , especially during the weekend, in order to do cardio exercises in the sport centers with the aim to get a better health condition. Secondly, people are currently enhancing the knowledge of getting a balanced life. Thanks to the ubiquity of mass media, citizens are encouraged to widen the awareness of staying fit and cut down on unhealthy foods consisted of high amounts of fat, leading a better healthy way of living.",
        "In conclusion, although it is hard for residents to keep fit in the current community, it seems to me that a healthy lifestyle still could be monitored and adjusted with many suitable strategies."
