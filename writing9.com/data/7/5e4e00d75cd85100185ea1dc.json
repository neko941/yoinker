        "A  generation  ago,  teaching  in  a  high  school  was  considered  an  extremely  well-respected and  popular  task,  and  in  some  countries  it  is  still  true.  However,  in  many  parts  of  the world,  there  has  been  a  sharp  drop  in  the  number  of  young  people  who  want  to become  high  school  teachers.  This  essay  will  look  at  the  reasons  for  this  and  propose some  solutions.",
        "One  of  the  main  causes  of  the  issue  is  that  teachers\u2019  salaries  are  lower  than  many other jobs.  Teachers\u2019  pay  has  not kept pace  with  that of  other professions,  such as  law  or medicine.  In  the  UK,  for  example,  a  doctor  with  five  years\u2019  experience  will  earn  far  more than  a  teacher  with  the  same  experience.  The  solution  is  for  the  government  to  raise teachers\u2019  pay  significantly,  which would  attract  more  people  into  the  profession. Another  problem  is  that  many  children  do  not  behave  well  in  class.  That  is  to  say, teachers  often  have  to  deal  with  pupils  who  disobey  them,  which  often  causes  them  to give  up  teaching.  This  tends  to  put  off  potential  teachers  as  well.  To  tackle  this  issue, parents  must  give  their  children  a  sense  of  respect  for  teachers,  in  order  to  make children behave  better  in class.",
        "At  third  cause  of  the  dispute  is  that  teachers  often  have  too  much  work  to  do.  Most teachers  are  snowed  under  with  marking  and  paperwork,  which  means  that  they  have  to stay  late  at  school  and  work  at  home  in  the  evening.  As  a  result,  many  teachers  are  tired and  stressed,  and  their  job  has  a  negative  effect  on  their  family  life.  The  way  forward could  be  cut  teachers\u2019  hours,  and  to  take  on  more  teaching  assistants,  which  would make  teaching  and  easier task.",
        "To  sum  up,  teaching  has  become  a  much  less  popular  job  in  many  countries,  due  to reasons  such  as  the  salary,  the  working  hours  and  pupils\u2019  behaviour.  This  is  a  serious problem,  and  unless  we  can  get  more  talented  young  people  to  become  teachers,  the education  of  our  children  will  suffer.  My  view  is  that  the  main  responsibility  for  solving the  problem  lies  with  parents  and  the  government."
