        "It is a fact that selecting a right career pathway is crucial for the youth's future life when they graduate from high school. Some youngsters\u00a0 prefer to travel around the world or working\u00a0in workforce to gain experience\u00a0before entering universities; while, others enrol themselves in post-secondary education right after the graduations. These two pathways will both have advantages for the youth.The\u00a0essay will discuss these two options\u00a0separately.",
        "To begin with, firstly,\u00a0 Spending time travelling or working will provide\u00a0opportunities for high school graduates\u00a0understand themselves better. The majority of\u00a0 them\u00a0may have limited knowledge about working industries or lack of self-awareness; therefore, it may be \u00a0a challenge for them to select a proper major that they are interested. For example, one-year travelling and working experiences will expand their horizontal knowledge and learn more about themselves. Moreover,\u00a0 they also earn some money for their tuition as well.\u00a0 As a result, the youth may mature enough to select their careers to pursue.",
        "However, some new graduates will attend universities right after high school. Firstly, they believe that travelling and working\u00a0will waste their precious time. Travelling will increase the risks for the youth to nurture negative habits, such as smoking, drinking, doing drugs, and so on. In addition, working in labour jobs will not benefit their personal developments\u00a0and sometimes, some of them may never go\u00a0back to colleges again.\u00a0Directly pursuing university education will assist students to stay concentration\u00a0in their academic study.",
        "In conclusion,\u00a0 whether having a short period for travelling or working or not depends on a high school graduate individually. I personally believe that they should make a serious decision after consulting their parents or mentors.\u00a0Travelling around and working may not be suitable for all students due to \u00a0the above reasons. However, pursuing advanced academic educations in universities play a significant role in\u00a0students' future life."
