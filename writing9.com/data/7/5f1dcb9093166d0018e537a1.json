        "Instead of imposing on government, it's every individual's duty to maintain once health. Because everyone needs are being sincere and faithful to themselves by meeting the necessary requirements for their own health. It's impossible for union to monitor on every single person, they can only help the public to regain their health by providing the best treatment. I believe that the public must be serious about their own health and fitness by doing regular exercise and taking balanced diet.",
        "As it is said that health is a wealth. Keeping this in mind, the public must be serious and be responsible about their own health. It's every individual's duty and right to be in charge and be master of themselves. Because health is a very personal thing which all must try to keep themselves fit. For example, in overseas, most of the people are staying single and alone. They are highly cautious about the health and fitness, therefore they tend to join on regular gyms and exercise. I believe that this regular routine of theirs is really effective and beneficial in maintaining themselves and they do it faithfully.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, it's absolutely far better that government do indulge in every once health and worry about pupils' fitness as the Union has their own role to play for the nation enlarge. If the union has to be involved in health of the person's then where is the pupils responsibility for their own health and if they don't take care of themselves first then what nation can expect from their citizen tomorrow in building up the country. The government could only provide the best facilities for treatment.For example, the Union has provided better and advanced health related facilities in the country and wish them better health and fitness.",
        "In summary, health is a personal responsibility that every one much take care and preserve it. The public must always meet all the measures to keep themselves fit. They should not out this burden on government and distract them from doing their duties."
