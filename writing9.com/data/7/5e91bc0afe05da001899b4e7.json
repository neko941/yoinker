        "In the current scenario, it is an undeniable fact that money has become an integral part of a person's day-to-day needs. Some people believe that investing leisure time to earn money is more important while others opine the other way in having more spare time when compared with money. This essay would succinctly look into both these views and would derive a plausible conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, financial stability lays a basic foundation to run a family without facing any difficulties in their routine life. In other words, money in the form of assets, liquid cash could provide a prosperous lifestyle, not only to the family at present but also to the children\u2019s future. To exemplify, an average educational expense in a globally recognized university would cost a fortune for a bachelor\u2019s degree, which could be difficult to pursue without financial support from family. Moreover, the extra income would aid to manage unexpected expenses such as medical emergencies as well as on job recession periods.",
        "On the other hand, there are myriad effects on a person in the aspect of both psychological and physiological. Focusing on the free time to improve mental and physical health could help people to relax in spite of the stress obtained from the work environment. For instance, 90% of the people who suffer cardiovascular diseases are the ones that did not get enough time to concentrate on their well being.",
        "To conclude, money plays an essential role in the present world for a better standard of life. However, the result of obtaining more money in exchange for free time might not always be fruitful. Thus I personally believe spending spare time to self heal rather than money is better considering the detrimental effects on an individual."
