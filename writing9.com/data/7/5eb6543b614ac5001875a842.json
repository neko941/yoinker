        "In our modern society, the trend among the youngsters of seeking employment opportunities in the cities by migrating from the less developed areas has become a matter of discussion for many. In my opinion, higher career options and better living standards are some of the main reasons behind this tendency. In this essay, I shall critically examine the given subject and outline the relevant examples to support my view.",
        "There are numerous predominant factors causing this shift in the society. To start with, many people are attracted towards the superior employment rates in the cities. Also, it is not uncommon to see a much lower number of job vacancies in the rural areas. For example, a recent study conducted at the Stanford University showed that people are 5 times more likely to secure a good job in the well developed cities than compared to the smaller or underdeveloped towns. Moreover, a higher quality of living standards is an another reason for this movement. As, the living standards in the cities are much more preferable in comparison to the rural areas.",
        "Consequently, this trend also have some advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, a greater number of skilled workers are now available to join the workforce. This result in the growth of the economy. However, it has also increased the competition among the applicants. Secondly, it is contributing to the expansion of the job market in a positive manner. For example, a report published by the Oxford University revealed that this migration is the primary reason behind the rapid development of many industries and organisations, which in turns grow the employment arena. In stark contrast, it is also responsible for the steep incline in the various environmental issues.",
        "In conclusion, this is a topic which raises many questions in the contemporary life. After a thorough analysis of the subject, it is clear that the positive aspects of this shift surpass the negative points. In the future, we could expect to witness this topic to be debated even further in search of a conclusive answer."
