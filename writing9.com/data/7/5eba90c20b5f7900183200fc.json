        "Some people are willing to get more experience and learn about different countries, that in the past it was a common idea that this information is only obtained by travelling, but in today's modern life, this can be done by using the internet or watching TV too. In my opinion, I suspect that visiting other places can be second to none way of getting knowledge from other foreign countries and I prefer it more than gain them via the technological devices because it is a real experience. In this essay we will discuss both aspects.",
        "Indeed, travelling beyond the boundaries of one's country have a numerous benefits and nothing can compare with it. Firstly, as it is a real experience you can get new feelings and impressions which you would never get from technologies. Secondly, you can provide a good understanding of their culture, you can taste their traditional food and so on. Moreover, you can communicate with new people and learn new thing that may help you in terms of study, Language or any other things.",
        "On the other hand, in considering the other viewpoint, that this experience can get from TV or the internet, the point can be mentioned, that nowadays, by developing technology at a rapid race there are lots of websites, TV_Shows, channels and many other things that they can make all of that things possible and accessible for us also they can be a powerful learning tool and be out of the world. You can sit at home and just by one click, all of the world would be available for you and it is a really first_rate.",
        "By the way of conclusion, actually by seeing the power of the technology, it is hard to say that travelling is the cream of the crop way to learn about other countries, however I believe that physically travelling would be more exciting and can have a more thrill."
