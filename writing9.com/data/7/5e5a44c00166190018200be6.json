        "Test or exam is a tool for measure knowledges or the abilities of students. Basic examination such as pen and paper exam have been the standard evaluation for a long time, but the others argue that it cannot the only way to assess intelligent of human. In this essay, I believe there are the other way to gauge the ability of students.",
        "Teacher and professor usually have used paper exam to evaluate knowledge of their student before and after learning. Paper exam is the basic tool and easy to assess. People who do well in exam normally wise or clever than the other or have a more diligent because they have to read many books to prepare the test. Furthermore, this test has developed for the long time and have many types. For instance, the multi-choice  exam  can evaluate basic knowledge quickly and writing-exam can check the deep knowledge of learners. However, some people who not good on paper-exam, it does not mean they are not cleaved.",
        "On the others hand, some people can do good in speaking or by doing. Nowadays, many researchers who are studying in the human cognition report that our learning is so different. Some people may be good to learn by listening, while someone good to learn by doing. Moreover, many jobs cannot learn from only theoretical book but need to learn it with a project such as \u201cArtist, Musician, or designer\u201d. These groups of people cannot evaluate their ability by paper test but their work. Similar to the paper-exam, it is not a worldwide examination to gauge every person",
        "In conclusion, paper-test are the good exam but it cannot evaluate every skill of human. Therefore, if it has the other way, such as group project or etc. Which likely more effective, we can use it and adapt in teaching. However, it do not mean who is good at the examination will successful, it is their life, there is a lot of skill that did not teach in college or university but have to learn in real life."
