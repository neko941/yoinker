        "Health problems are the most concerning issue for the humankind throughout the world. These are caused in different ways, like fleas, virus, but there are some other reasons which are affecting the health of common people one of them is because of consuming more fast food. Governments are advising people now and then not to have excess amount of high calorie meals, but the results are not fruitful so there is a suggestion that to implement more tax on these kind of menu to have control on this issue but in my opinion it is a great idea to implement. This essay, will discuss the outcomes of having high tax rates on these kind of meals.",

So it is a very good move by a country to impose more rate on these to have an impact."
