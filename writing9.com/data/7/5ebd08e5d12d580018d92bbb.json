        "Some people argue that the disparity between the high and the low economic groups in the society is widened by the advancement of the technology,  whereas the rest has opposing views.  My personal perspective is although  modern machineries hamper job opportunities for labourers, overall, it improves the life in a plethora of ways reducing the gap between the different income categories.",
        "To begin with, expanding the gap between the rich and the poor is happening through reduction in employment opportunities for the labour providing workforce. This is because the automation replaces requirement of the manpower through sophisticated machinery and as a result, less skilled workers lose their occupation. For an example, after modernizing the most of the chocolate factories with new automated machinery during  the recent past in the UK, thousands of workers had to leave their jobs resulting them in the poverty. However, I disagree with this notion because people can find novel methods of earning through the technology.",
        "On the other hand, the modern technology flourishes the life in multiple ways of the poor as well. In fact, the utilisation of the machinery in the agriculture improves the food production increasing their availability to the poor. Thus, the daily lifestyle is facilitated by the advance communication methods, transport services and modern household equipments all of which have been gifted by the technology. For an instance,a recent survey done in Sri Lanka has revealed that the use of machinery in paddy cultivation not only reduce the price of rice but also provide greater income to the farmers.Hence, lower socioeconomic class is able to uplift the status in many ways through integrating their livelihood with the modern technological outcomes. I agree with this school of thoughts because the technology is available to the poor also.",
        "In conclusion, the modern automation is narrowing the dispatch between the rich and the poor through enhancing and facilitating their lives in a number of ways, although automation plummets employments for manual labourers."
