        "Nowadays, numerous platforms offer distance-learning programs and have been trending for a few past years. A section of society holds a belief that joining the distance-based education program is not similar to attending physical classes at any educational institution but many folks still do so. This essay will highlight why virtual-based learning is superior than face to face education, as well as my perspective on this issue.",
        "On the one hand, virtual-based learning might be effective teaching method style compared to physical-based learning. Today's students have a better intuitive understanding of how to utilize their screen-based technologies to find their education sources, unlike the previous era. Recent news by psychology research, at least 65% of input is acquired by students when studying online, whereas only 40% of students are able to absorb all the information during their physical classes. Therefore, folks must avail this kind of accessibility need to be optimally utilized in order to generate holistic students in the future.",
        "On the other hand, face-to-face learning, undeniably has its own merits which are unavailable for virtual-type of education. Some students are kinesthetic learner, which means online-learning education is not compatible for everyone since this kind of student needs an interactive environment. For instance, there are quite a plethora of depression cases that occurred among students during the pandemic outbreak recently due to online-distance learning in Malaysia. Thus, it is no doubt, that not everyone can adopt to this education style.",
        "In conclusion, although virtual learning education is more likely efficient in many ways, physical learning offers a communicative surrounding which will be a huge assistance for students understanding. Hence, i partially agree that virtual-based education offers the same benefits as physical education does."
