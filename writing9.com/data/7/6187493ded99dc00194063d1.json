        "According to many,  income is one of the most critical factors for a living when finding employment whereas others opinion that opportunity ought to provide satisfaction and maintain apply the balance in life. This essay discusses both views as it discusses the usage of earnings of employees; thereafter, it will clarify the importance of satisfaction at work and work-life balance for employees.",
        "To initiate with,  income is one of the most vital motivations for employees to improve living. Monetary usage has numerous utilisation, which depends on various needs as a few numbers of employees must fulfil their basic needs of food, cloth, and shelter. Another group utilises\u2019 money for social recognition as these groups earnings ought to fulfil their social status such as members of a particular  club or society of elites; therefore, fulfiling the basic needs for these groups is merely not sufficient. In the UK, for instance, 5 per cent of the top job holders of FTSE 100 companies utilise most of their money on fancy stuff according to the source of the daily mail. Therefore, financial motivation is vital and affect employee lifestyles.",
        "In contrast, work satisfaction and work-life balance are also vital for a certain group of employees rather than cash. These  groups of employees try to find job satisfaction from professions at the workplace, which can be offered via challenging employment opportunities. Furthermore, these  individuals require flexible hours for their work due to family issues, which is more critical for them rather than cash. For example, 20 per cent of parents in the developed world require support from family members  in their personal lives. Consequently, these family  members require flexible working hours at the workplace rather than high earnings due to their family issues.",
        "To conclude, cash can provide satisfaction to the employees, who have basic demands and social recognition whereas other groups of the employee get satisfaction through challenging work and flexible time. There is no right choice from both of these options when considering satisfaction at work in my view."
