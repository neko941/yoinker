        "Let me explain my situation. As you know, I have a family of 3 including my younger daughter, who is just 6 months old. The problem is that, my new neighbour is creating so many problems, including, plays music loudly at night on a regular basis. This creates a lot of nuisance to us. Moreover, my daughter is often crying after hearing the loud noise.",
        "Would you please do the needful to rectify this issue as soon as possible. So that we can live there peacefully. Apart from that we are enjoying staying here, because this place has such a captivating ambience and all the amenities are wonderful too. I suggest you to please allow us to move to the apartment near to the river or leave that man from there.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
