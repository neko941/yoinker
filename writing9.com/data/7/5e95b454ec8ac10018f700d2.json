        "People have different views about the question of should the government support university\u2019s student the school fees. While some argue that, I believe that students better get the donation given by the politics.",
        "There are several reasons why people don\u2019t agree with the opinion that higher education should be sponsored by the government. They may assert that students who are funded the money will be irresponsible. One reason for this is that the young generation will not seriously study maybe because they don\u2019t respect the money that is not their parents or even themselves\u2019s income. For instance, when they have the grant from the authority, it\u2019s understandable that they have more time and pocket money to indulge in their pleasure without learning spirit. As the result, people estimate students will become lazier and lazier, and the studies fall down.",
        "In spite of this argument, I side with those who hold the view that the administration should spend their budget on supporting those individuals. With the financial support, it\u2019s apparent that students can concentrate on their studies and broaden their horizons as well as experiments. Especially for those who want to do occupations that contribute to the community, such as doctors, polices, firefighters... These people need help from the government so they can try their best to ready to devote to the society.. This means both education and the country\u2019s civilization rate will go up to approach the higher.",
        "In conclusion, supporting youngsters the tuition fees is likely to be the better way to develop the education as well as the country\u2019s social order."
