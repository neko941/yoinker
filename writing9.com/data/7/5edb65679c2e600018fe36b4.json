        "Nowadays, there are varying views among professionals regarding the right time to introduce a new language to school children. While certain experts consider it necessary to start teaching school children distant language at the elementary level, others belong to the school of thought that it should be initiated at the secondary level. I think that the gains associated with the introduction of a foreign language at primary school surpass the setbacks.",
        "To begin with, there are two major benefits that come with the introduction of a foreign language to pupils. One of them is effective communication within and outside the school premises. In other words, they find it easy to associate with their peers. Also, it increases fluency in conversation. Another important merit is that, acquiring knowledge of a distant language helps in the development of cognitive skills and language proficiency. This is to say that, people who are multilingual in nature developed this skill at an early stage of their lives because of exposure to foreign languages. For example, studies carried out at the University of Lagos show that the student who won the first prize at the French Language Quiz competition started learning new languages while still in primary school.",
        "Despite these benefits, the introduction of a new language to pupils suffers some criticisms. One major drawback is that the youngsters will lose their mother tongue if a foreign language is added into the school curriculum. This is because their brains are not matured to comprehend both vernacular and new language. Water is more, pupils that are exposed to the latter do not master either of the languages? This, in turn, poses some challenges such as stage fright and bashfulness. Consequently, they find it difficult to mix up with their peers. For instance, children that grew up outside their fatherland could barely speak their native language fluently, so they feel shy to talk in a public gathering.",
        "To sum up, it is obvious that tutoring youngsters distant language at primary school level have both positive and negative sides. Despite the challenges, I believe that upsides such as effective communication and cognitive development far outweigh the downsides."
