        "The importance of purchasing daily needs by using current technology which was always debatable has now become more controversial with many people claiming that it is beneficial while others reject its notion.The substantial influence of indicated direction has sparked controversy over its potential impact in recent years.In my opinion , the former propositional appears to be more rational.This essay will further elaborate my views of this movement thus",
        "will lead to a logical conclusion.",
        "There are myriad reasons which will freshly explain this argument but the most preponderant one stems from the fact that by utilizing internet-based visa cards,MasterCard gives more flexibility while e-commerce transactions. Another pivotal aspect of this argument is that it gives a big opportunity to buy anything from anywhere through online based shopping platforms;daraz,amazon,Alibaba & so on. Needless to say,all these merits stand in good stead.",
        "However, there are some pitfalls that negate these arguments & which can certainly overwhelm the potential influence of this tendency but one of the most alarming is that e-commerce businesses may fraud the customer like; submit an order for a t-shirt but they deliver cosmetics items. Besides, it is a lengthy process when anyone submits an order from outside of the country & sometimes customers get the products after or passed the mentioned time in their deadline . Hence, it is apparent why many are against this tendency.",
        "According to the arguments aforementioned above,one can reach a conclusion that the benefits of the latest technology for online transactions are instrumental indeed.",
        "Nevertheless , its potential drawbacks should not be overlooked either."
