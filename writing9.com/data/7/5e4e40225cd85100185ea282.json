        "Owing to the advancement in the field of science and technology, there is a possibility that people can live up to 150 years. Although it is advantageous for the individual, it possesses a dangerous impact on the society. This essay will examine the benefits and drawbacks of people living to 150.",
        "The old age people can work better than their younger counterparts, because they have developed a better understanding of this world. For instance, an elderly scientist can contribute more effectively to the field of science than the younger generation. Because they have spend a significant amount of time in experimenting the new ideas. Furthermore, they can spend more time with their loved one. Which produces a positive impact on the person himself and the society. Therefore, youngsters can learn from the experience of the people who live longer and they themselves can enjoy their life a little longer.",
        "Living to 150 has its own drawbacks, because a person can no longer live an independent life. To illustrate, old age is linked to many diseases such as osteoporosis. Many old age women suffer from it. Consequently, their quality of life is affected, because their bones become weak. They become dependent on others. Hence, the dependency on others is the drawback of living a longer life.",
        "To conclude, people can possibly live longer in the foreseeable future. It is good for a person, but it may produce negative consequences for the society. The vast experience and to cherish life for a long period are the benefits of living to 150, while dependency is the main risk."
