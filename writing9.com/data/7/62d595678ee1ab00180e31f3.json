        "Nowadays, young children use computers so frequently that some even use them for more than 10 hours every day. Although some people believe that the phenomenon has no harmful effects on young children, I agree that the disadvantages of it outweigh the advantages.",
        "To begin with, the benefits of using a computer are widely admitted. As high-tech tools, computers provide offspring with diversified methods to help them learn efficiently. Animated web pages and incentive applications are designed for teaching and inspiring them to access more information  and that process expands their horizons as a result. Also, heir are attracted easily by the interactions in educational computer programs, so  they absorb knowledge effectively in a lively atmosphere, and it proves to be welcomed by both parents and teachers.",
        "On the other hand, the negative impacts of using a computer every day need to be emphasised. Since young children have only acquired inadequate self-control, they are likely to be addicted to computers, video games in particular. Spending too much time on computer games, children will lose  interest in studying as well as communicating with their peers. Moreover, their values and perspectives of the real world might not be well developed once they fall in love with the virtual world, which will have a detrimental influence on their future. Again, using computers for long hours has both physical and psychological effects that would be even more devastating for young children.",
        "In conclusion, though computers are helpful to youngsters\u2019 study, the adverse effects they bring weigh more. It is acceptable that youngsters use computers two or three times a week, but parents still need to be aware of the unhealthy information on the internet and video games addiction of their offspring."
