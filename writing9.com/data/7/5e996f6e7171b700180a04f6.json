        "Firstly, elderly people are playing our surroundings; The approximate life expectancy has been increasing in the past few decades or so, hence the peculiar phenomena of dramatic development in the total of seniors among our population. Surprisingly, this increase not only bring smiles, but also frowns like anything in life, and in this essay both negative and positive effects are discussed.",
        "On one hand,    the proportional increase in the number of senior has many merits in my opinion. Moreover, any country witnessing the previous phenomena indicates, in my opinion, a strong  medical system and improved lifestyle. For further elaboration, in such countries relentless screening for common diseases and vigilante medical insurance to assure that most of the population falls under its coverage. Furthermore, seniors are crucial to society in terms of wisdom and broad perspective that they can offer to youngsters  which is invaluable, to put it in other words, more kids will find guidance. Hence, the importance of the overall increase number of seniors.",
        "Secondly, on the other hand, like anything else in the world this phenomena  have some drawbacks.  additionally,  scientists have proven that humans, as we get older our immune system takes a more kick back attitude  which means in the case of a pandemic, such as the COVID19 seniors and elderly citizens are the weakest link in our society and also among the majority of fatalities due to their impaired immune system. Surprisingly, the blissful increase in the number of seniors would be a heavy burden in terms of medical cost, which will take its toll on the  government  budget.",
        "Finally, seniors are the cornerstone of any society, although, they might need costly care, but their output  to our community is priceless."
