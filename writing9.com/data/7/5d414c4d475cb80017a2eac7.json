        "With the rapid pace of commercialization in various developing nations, there are a plenty of job opportunities available for the umemployed people. While most of the employers concentrate on the academic qualifications or the previous working experience, in my opinion, the companies should focus more on the skills and other private factors to determine best candidate for the placement. I completely agree to such a measure, which can help both the candidate as well as the recruiter.",
        "First of all, when top priority for recruitment is given to a skillful and talented candidate, it not only gives the candidate a perfect platform to make proper utilization of his skills, but also the recruiter receives several benefits from the important practical knowledge of the selected candidate. For instance, the top online company named Google, recruits most of the people for lower positions, who have the required skills rather than the educational credits. Use of the skills is crucial for innovation, which inturn empower the success of an organization.",
        "Furthermore, such a measure gives a great financial benefit to the job offering brand. Fresh candidates, who do not have any prior experience, are available at comparatively lower salary package than the other regular job seekers, who have reputed academic degrees. For example, according to a report issued by the Employment Agency of India, fresh job lookers expect 40 percent less annual salary than the experienced class. Such a saving can be very economical for an organization.",
        "In conclusion, with the increased amount of available work options, it is often considered better to make the selection process based on the personal factors of the applicant. This essay agrees completely with the proposed consideration due to its several advantages for the employees as well as the companies."
