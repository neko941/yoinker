        "The world has become a global village where people share the same interests and follow the same trends. Although this situation seems to be advantages to bring people worldwide together, I believe this trend harbours many negative implications rather than positive ones.",
        "Firstly, when people purchase the same international commodities, this consequently detriments many countries economically. Most of products that attract people from all over the world, such as smart phones and trendy clothes, are manufactured by big companies in the developed countries. This affects the local industry in the less developed and developing countries. In Egypt, for example, many Egyptians prefer to shop for fashionable clothes from high-end transnational stores rather than to buy clothes from local stores that sell \u201cmade in Egypt\u201d products. This result in a significant decline in sales of domestic goods and even closure of many national businesses. It proves that when individuals in all countries become able to get the same items, it has undesirable influence on local economies.",
        "Secondly, buying things is a way that people use to express their interests and preferences. When someone purchases an international popular product, it means that this person is keen to follow global trends. If this has become an increasing attitude between individuals, it will wipe their culture identities to adopt the newly coming trends. It is common now, for instance, to see people all over the world wearing the same clothes and abandoning their local costumes. Eventually this cultural change will not stop at choice of clothes and it will expand to dominate all aspects of life and pale all cultural richness.",
        "In conclusion, if individuals all over the globe shop for the same items, this development will have harmful potentials on national businesses and will eclipse their cultural identity."
