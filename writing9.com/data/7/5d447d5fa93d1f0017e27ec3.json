        "It has argued that retailers should trade in locally made food instead of foreign ones. In my opinion, I totally agree that only the edibles that are made in the locality should  be sold around because, they are fresh, less expensive and their production helps reduce unemployment scandal.",
        "Firstly, perishable goods that are produced natively are usually fresh. In other words, their freshness makes them healthy for consumption because the vitamins and minerals would not have been altered due to processing and they would also meet the daily nutritional requirements as proposed by the Dietary Association.  As a result, the number of people visiting the hospitals due to food poisoning would reduce drastically.  For instance, when the government of China banned the importation of foreign foods, they discovered that the incidence of gastroenteritis reduced from 78% to 35%.",
        "Another point to consider is, local foods are cost effective.  Unlike foreign ones which have the cost of packaging, preservation, transportation and other logistics added to their final selling price, local foods are affordable and even the poor and middle class citizens can purchase healthy meals at give away prices.  In addition, the production of local foods encourages employment.  In essence, the number of unemployed citizens will drop and this invariably, will improve the economy of the nation.  For example, the government of The Republic of Benin, reported a 58% decline in the rate of unemployment when there was an embargo on importation of foods.",
        "In conclusion, when local shops engage in the sales of locally made goods, citizens will consume fresh foods, become healthier, the cost of purchasing such foods will be pocket-friendly and unemployment will be brought down to the bearest minimum."
