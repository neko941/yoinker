        "Dear Sean,",
        "I heard you are planning of going on a camping holiday in the Montana mountains for the first time this summer and I`m happy to give you some tips and advice.",
        "On the one hand, the camping trip will be an exciting one. Although  the Montana mountain range is a challenging one, you will be able to witness some beautiful sceneries out there such as waterfalls, lakes and tea plantations.",
        "On the other hand, you have to be cautious about certain things. Firstly, there are plenty of leeches around the camping site. Secondly, you have to be careful with other kinds of insects, for example, mosquitos, spiders and red ants. Finally, the bad weather might push you through some difficult times, as a result, you might have a hard time  setting up the camp.",
        "Thank you so much for the invitation. Although  I would love to join  you, I won't be able to make it since I have my exams in the first week of next month. But I`m sure you will have an adventurous and  memorable camping holiday.",
        "If you would like to know more information, feel free to give me a call.",
        "Good luck.",
