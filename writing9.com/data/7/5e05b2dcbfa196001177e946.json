        "It is often argued, these days it is getting challenging for the graduates to get a job in their respective fields of expertise. This could be due to the mismanagement by the Government and the private sector to appoint people. The solution would be getting flexible and implement a fair merit system.",
        "I believe the primary reason for not getting a field-related job after graduation is an unfair system and appointments. In many countries, there are no specific criteria about how to select a proper person for the appropriate position, which could be due to a flawed system and corrupt officials. When graduates apply for a job, they made many objections to them, and one would be less experience. As a result, the right person has not been selected and ends up doing the job which is not related to their field, and sometimes can lead to depression among the educated professionals. For example , when a highly trained professional who migrated from their parent country to different western countries for better opportunities. They are ended by driving a taxi or Uber or doing other menial jobs due to their super time-consuming system and never-ending wait time.",
        "In my opinion, the solution to this problem is quite challenging because the flawed system has many aspects; therefore it's supremely hard to manage or correct. However, if this problem could be handled with sincerity, delicacy, and good intention, it would be solved.  When concerned regulated bodies should be flexible towards their rules related to experience, for instance and scrutinized people with positive intentions. As a consequence, many people can do jobs in which they are trained. Just a stepping stone could be when the rules related to experience could be relaxed and adequately differentiate for young and older graduates can impact the lives of many professionals positively.",
        "In conclusion, the tertiary level graduates are not succeeding in getting the job in their respective fields these days due to the unfair appointing system, and the solution could be relaxing the concerned authorities should be more accommodating."
