        "Nowadays, human\u2019s right is really popular, so that, a lot of gay marriages have happened. Some think that this trend will have a bad consequence on society but others believe that nowadays, human has an individual right to love without sexualities' prejudices.",
        "First of all, I completely agree that people can choose their own partners freely and gay marriage should be legal. From my point of view, we decide to devote someone because we adore not only them but also ourselves. Obviously, loving someone doesn\u2019t mean that you want to do everything for that person, it means that you want that person to respect you, make you happy in order that you do not even care about the price to let him or her partner you.",
        "On the other hand,  some parents prohibit their children from loving someone of the same sexuality. But they don\u2019t know that action makes everything worse. For example, in the past, their parents prohibited them from natural marriage and then force them to marry a gay, what would happen? Would they agree with it? Of course, the answer is No. Let have a quick comparison, do you feel this example is familiar, with LGBT society, the other sexuality is the same as their bio-sexuality, they just have interests in people who have the same sexual orientation as them. Your force a gay guy to marry a girl just the same as you force a man to marry other men.",
        "To be concluded, people have a right to choose their wife or husband. They already know and completely know what they want. If you are not a part of LGBT society, You\u2019d better look out for yourself, let them be free to do whatever they want. All of us deserve to be loved."
