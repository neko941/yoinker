Finally, I got my update and offer letter on 22nd April, Thursday and was selected for the post as a database administrator and I need to join the company on 1st June.",

So, I booked a table in the Hilton hotel in Sharjah for coming Saturday to have a dinner and to celebrate this success. Also, they have some live concert, which you like most to watch and hence I planned for that too.",
        "I know that you are free on Saturday and Sunday and you can start by Friday evening from Abu Dhabi and you can reach the Sharjah early morning. I booked a room for you in Hilton hotel itself, so that you can take some rest. Hope you will not be having any other important task and this plan will work out for you.",
