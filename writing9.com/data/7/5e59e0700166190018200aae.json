        "Hope this letter finds you in the pink of health. I am very excited to let you know that I got accepted to Albany State University. Having said that, I am anxious about the expense part now. As you have been living in Albany for sometime now, I would require your help to find a part-time job in Albany to cover my living expenses.",
        "To begin with, I have been accepted for the master's degree program in computer science at Albany State University. The program is a two year full time program.  My classes begin in June this year.",
        "Although I have received scholarship for the program, it is only sufficient to cover my course expenses. I have researched extensively about living expenses in Albany. The rent along with other expenses like food are simply unaffordable for me to bear. Therefore I would need a part-time job to make ends meet.",
        "Finally, if you could look up for part-time jobs in local job sites it will be very helpful. I am willing to work as an attendant at a gas station or wait tables at restaurants.  Since you are well connected can you enquire if there are any suitable openings?",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Regards,",
        "Joe."
