        "Although, I've just started a new science project, and I've been working around the clock. It's been intense! I don't mean to complain; I've been enjoying it immensely, and the company I'm working at is actually in our old high school. Do you remember Mrs Brown, the former office? Her's office is actually mine now!",
        "However, could you let me know another time, which suits you so I can visit? For me, the best time would be during the summer holidays, July or August if that's ok with you? For example, I am able to travel during the Christmas breaks and if you're available then. I'd certainly love to escape all the madness and visit you at your new home.",
