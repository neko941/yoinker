        "In this modern world we see differences in every country. Some countries are economically strong and others have tremendous manpower. That's why it is necessary to help poor nations in terms of fulfilling the basic needs of developing nations. The government of backward nations is also responsible, but I believe the help of wealthy countries will give extra support to build nation's economy.",
        "Few countries are developed in the world. They are capable to maintain balance between the needs and demands of their own people. Poorer country's government is also responsible for their own growth because the common individuals elected them with hopes. The authority should focus on how they can encourage nation in various sectors such as agriculture, small scale business and so on. So that this can build the sources of income. Furthermore it will help to common people, to fulfil their  basic needs. I agree there are some drawbacks they could face such as the insufficient amount of natural resources and the field's are not able to grow a variety of food. At that time the government of poorer countries should ask help from developed nations.",
        "In the above situation, wealthy nation should help them. So that the authority can help to feed their basic needs likewise food and education. It will help poorer countries to focus on different problems rather than thinking on essential problems. Education will grow and develop the knowledge of individuals and support them to find out solutions for further calamities. Developed nation tries to support them on a certain timeline else it will spread the wrong message with citizens and they will become unproductive. Also try to force them to use these funds only for primary needs.",
        "In conclusion, wealthy nations are becoming more advance because of hard work and dedication. Without their guidance poorer countries cannot build long term plans for their own citizens to fulfil basic needs."
