        "It is often argued that individuals are getting more curious about the history of the builds they live in. As a result, they try to find those pieces of information as nowadays people are more exposed to new knowledge. The following paragraphs will highlight the reasons for that and some relevant examples.",
        "First of all, people have been more interested in knowing the past as well as discovering the previous history of the buildings. Besides this being a such fun thing for some people, it can also be important as many old ones need maintenance and repair. For instance, an old building could be stunning in old-fashioned style, but it could probably not stand for long as it is essential to have some modifications. For that reason, people with the knowledge would not just be curious, but also concerned about the structure and safety.",
        "Nowadays, it is extremely easy to research for professionals in the area, such as architecture. They could analyze the building, and make some studies and modifications if needed. Therefore, a professional would not only give some pieces of information about it but also keep the safety of the place. For example, some buildings are made of old contents that latterly we do not use anymore and it could be dangerous if not checked.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, people have become more curious about the building as they have more knowledge about historic things and also to keep themselves safe. For that, people just need to find a professional in the area."
