        "Nowadays there are a lot of options available for higher education. As such, many are selecting overseas colleges for tertiary education. In this essay, I will consider the perceived drawbacks of this trend, and explain why I believe that the merits are far more significant.",
        "There are two major disadvantages of obtaining foreign education. The most critical one is that many students would feel lonely in a foreign land. Some students might feel depressed when they start living alone as they would start missing their family,friend, and traditional foods, even though they are excited to live in a new place. Another convincing point is that many courses offered in these places do not have adequate recognition in their home countries. Studying professional certifications containing local tax and law are of no value as the laws and the tax rules vary from one country to another.",
        "Although there are some demerits, there are far more positives that can come from studying abroad. The most prominent fact is that these youngsters are exposed to different cultures when they study in a foreign institution. Indeed, in these universities, they would be students from different countries and from diverse cultural backgrounds, and thus cultural exchange happens. In terms of personal growth, this type of student would learn to live independently at a very young age. Most of them would start doing part-time jobs or would be careful while spending money in order to manage their monthly expenses with the limited money available. The more prestigious the university, the better job prospects.",
        "In conclusion, students will continue to opt for foreign universities for higher education. In my perspective, although there are some limitations such as lack of recognition of some degrees and personal issues, the exposure and other personal developments obtained are much more valued at the end of the day."
