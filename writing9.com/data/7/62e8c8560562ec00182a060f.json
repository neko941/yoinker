        "Firstly, the thesis deadline and my sister's marriage fall on the same weekend in the coming month. Although that week I would be travelling to my native Spain thus both tasks can not be performed at the same time. Moreover,I have always achieved great scores in my academics throughout my course if you wish I can share all my certificates and previous records. I even achieved golds in scientific research presenting University.I always felt proud of being part of such a great campus.",
        "Finally, I request you to please alter the dates of thesis submission as any day of the next week after the marriage can be suitable for me of marriage as such an occasion does not appear again in life.",

        "Yours Sincerely",
