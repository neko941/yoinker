        "I am writing this letter to show my concern about the room service. I have recently booked a room in your hotel for my trip. It was a really hot day, when I reached at the hotel room, I found out that the air condition in the room is out of order.",
        "Let me explain further, I called the room service and enquired about the cooling system. The room service showed a quick response and called the contractor to fix the air condition. However, the contractor said it is requiring a replacement and cannot be repaired. Therefore, I asked to change the room but unfortunately, there all the rooms were booked for that night in the hotel. Thus, I had to sleep in a hot weather without any air conditioning.",
        "I would like you to take serious action on this and fix the faulty item in the room to the earliest possible so that others customers can avoid the consequences. Moreover, because I spent a night in unbearable hot weather, I would ask for a refund of my amount.",
        "Thank you for your consideration.",
