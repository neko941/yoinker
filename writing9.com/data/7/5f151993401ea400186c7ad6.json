        "In modern society, the environment and economy have been of growing concern. It is believed that a country has the ability to improve both economically prosperous and have no environmental pollutions.The mentioned method may work to a certain extent, but I reckon that there are effective ones.",
        "On the one hand, sustainable economy cannot happen without the harmful of effects of environment issues.The main reason is that the demand for energy witnessed a downward trend. Accordingly, a lot of industrial factories sprout up. These problems will lead to water pollution and air pollution.As can be seen from the news, Nn Viet Nam, the industry is on the rise made that waste such as sewage, emissions discharged into the atmosphere, the rivers.That matter has brought about a great economic potential for Viet Nam, but it is heavily polluted.Another reason is that exploiting resources are on the increase.That means it is the result of a resident\u2019s request, lead to be woefully inadequate fossil fuel and deforestations.",
        "On the other hand, I suppose that aforementioned approach is efficacious for the long-term.We are living in a throw-away society,especially plastic things.So, the government should heavily invest in using more goods,which is easy to recycle, bio-degradable. Thus, it would be a major contributor to decrease a host of trash. For instance, in 2020 France nudged citizen towards buying single-use products.Because of that, this viable solution has significantly reduced the amount of waste, fell from 1.6 billion tonnes to 900 million.Objection to that reason, the authority should care about alternative energy sources such as solar, wind energy.The natural resources could be reduced, and this is being widely embraced.",
        "In conclusion, economic flourish and environmental protections would be possible with the variety of feasible measures."
