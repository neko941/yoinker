        "Numerous people are presuming that zoos are vicious, and they are not feasible to disclose freely to the public. However, others opine that zoos are efficacious to be acknowledged as the conservator of animals. Thus, this essay will depict both fathoms and my personal opinions concomitantly.",
        "First of all, the existence of zoos warrants the quality of sanitation of wild animals. In other words, zoos have already conserved plenty of brutes from being arbitrarily hounded. Additionally, creatures that are preserved in a zoo are bestowed some distinctive nutrients like vitamins as an adjunct in order to obtain a superior level of health. Furthermore, as excursionists are permitted to access the zoo, academic institutions could straight-forwardly instruct their pupils exclusively toddler to concretely witness some animals and their particular hallmarks as well.",
        "Nonetheless, the availability of animals living in the zoo sometimes is being harnessed illicitly. Further, several nonchalant parties frequently undertake some exhibitions intending to attain funds for their financial business. For instance, some zoos are conducting many performances which compel the beasts to demonstrate some abominable actions, such as rolling in the fire. Moreover, some managers of the zoos are often suspected to partake in some illegal trades that enable perpetrators to purchase wild beasts at a more reasonable price.",
        "All in all, the presence of zoos is carrying on many merits and repercussions which are contingent on the methodologies taken to superintend the zoo. Nevertheless, in order to avert the occurrence of exploitation to some creatures, the government should strictly compose a few ordinances that must be effective to prevent some criminal demeanors such as annihilating or abusing."
