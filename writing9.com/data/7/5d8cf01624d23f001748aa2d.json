        "Instead of considering the very old ethics of life, such as honour, kindness and trust as the real worth of a human, a school of thought, claims people's  social dignity and materialistic things as worth. This essay completely disagrees with the fact because, real respect and honour comes from good deeds rather, from all the glitters that a man earns during his whole life and the materialistic things are just temporary but a man's kindness and greatness are always remembered.",
        "Since, the ages, a large part of the civilization always keeps themselves busy in earning things which they think that will earn a value for them in the eyes of society. Despite of knowing the fact that this is a kind of illusion because they are not going to stay for ever and will be lost in the storm of time. History has witnessed many similar instances, such as- The father of India-Mr.  M.K Gandhi. Despite of hailing from a rich family, he decided to serve for the humanity and for his nation. It was because of his efforts and ideas only that led India towards her freedom from British rule and that is why he is remembered till today.",
        "Now, one fact that can never be neglected that it's the tendency of humans to opt that road only which serves his motives or eases him and his belongings lives all together. It is normally very difficult for a person to focus himself towards the social causes and issues. No one wants to emphasize such issues, but there are few who are completely different from others. It's not because they do not have anything to do or they intentionally do that. It's only because their intent to help others which they might carried from their ancestors. For example, Mr. Ratan Tata- The chairman of Tata Group. This organisation is one of the biggest and most successful organisations of the world. He runs many NGOs who are relentlessly working for the betterment of the society. Knowing the fact that he is one of the richest persons of the world,  he is very down to earth and is always ready to help in any condition.",
        "In the light of the above facts, it is clear that materialistic things can earn only an illusion, but the real respect comes from the deeds, kindness, humbleness of a person."
