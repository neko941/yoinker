        "Machinery has been developing and is used by lots of people including education. Some people believe that automation is a useful tool for studying. However, many people argue that it is detrimental to the studying process. In my opinion, I strongly agree with those viewpoints that relate to machinery in education.",
        "Machinery has brought about some benefits of studying. Firstly, the Internet has provided students access the information globally. For instance, students can access old and new information which has been published by lots of websites all around the world by clicking on those websites. As a result, they definitely extend their knowledge and acquire useful ability in order to develop themselves. In addition,  Education in recent days is not only a traditional study method of learning at school. However, automation has invented a new educational platform which is called \u201cstudy online\u201d. In fact, lots of schools are operating online study for their students. Consequently, students are able to study with their instructor online via Zoom or other platforms which is similar to studying at school and also grant knowledge from studying online.",
        "On the other hand, automation also provides a negative effect on the studying process. The main impact of studying is that students trust information and depend on machinery. In this case students might probably use their devices to take a photo from a whiteboard instead of taking notes in the book. Under these circumstances, the students may cause laziness and lack of innovation. Furthermore, the possibility of plagiarism from other available sources on the internet can be done by students.",
        "To summarize, even automation delivers the benefit of studying by gaining the students' knowledge for a ton of sources on the internet, howeverhowever it also causes to decrease the students educational performance. Even though it has many useless things, however I encourage you to use it effectively and in a good way."
