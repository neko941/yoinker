        "These days, care of medical is developed significantly. It is true that people can live longer as well as expectance of life is also increased. In my opinion, I think that the benefits of medical development are living with family and travelling to all over the world far outweigh than the negatives.",
        "Although, there are some major benefits of the development of medical care which are living with family and travelling to any places of the earth. Firstly, people can live with their family by the help of this developed medical care. In other words, people can take new service of medical and spend the full valuable lifetime with family. Secondly, people can visit to the world more and more and enjoy the moment. That is to say that, progressed medical treatment teach people about the value of life and for this reason, people wants to enjoy. As a result, they go out and visit all over the world. For instance, my cousin Shihab broked his one hand and improved the injury in a very short time by the help of new medical treatment. He visited England, Canada, and Australia for enjoying the good time when he recovered because he learned the value of life. Besides, people can learn the value and spend the life pleasantly by the help of medical treatment.",
        "On the other hand, There are some disadvantages of medical progression which are expensive as well as dangerous for older people. One problem is developed medical care is so much expensive. Therefore, poor people cannot handle the amount and they are dying out. Another issue is that, older people cannot take the pressure of new technological health service because they get hurt. For example, my grandmother cannot handle the effect of therapy and she died in the hospital at treatment time. Moreover, medical treatment developed, but cross the limitation for poor and older people.",
        "In conclusion, improvement of medical is progressing. However, I personally think that the advantages of it far outweigh rather than some expensive and hurting problem issues."
