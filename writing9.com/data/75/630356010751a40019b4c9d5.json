They say that previous generations were under more pressure, but the idea of suffering from stress did not exist.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.",

        "Stress is a common word in everybody's life. Some communities believe that currently, people are suffering from more stress compared to earlier days while some other communities argue with this matter and say that, In past days, people were  very stressed compared to now but they didn't recognize their stress. In this essay, I will discuss both scenarios and then I will give my opinion on this matter.",
        "On the one side, Presently, In this modern era, people are getting stressed more due to various reasons. People feel stress when they feel pressure on their bodies. Mental pressure leads to more stress compared to physical work pressure. Nowadays, almost every person in this world is facing mental pressures which are leading to stress problems. Due to advancements in technologies, traffic problems, etc people are feeling stressed. For example, A person, who is working in a software company needs to work more than 10 hours per day in front of a computer system and he/she should wait in traffic to reach his/her home/office. Another good example is, due to pollution also people are facing stress.",
        "On the other side, Earlier, people used to do more physical work. By doing physical work their body will feel stress but they will be recovered by getting some rest and taking healthy food. In earlier times, Food is fresh and there are no fertilizers. For instance, Earlier, mostly every person is a farmer, they will go physical work more and eat healthy food and then they will some sleep to overcome that stress.",
        "To sum up, In my view I agree with the former statement that compared to earlier days, people are feeling more stress in this modern era. This stress can be overcome by eating healthy food, doing regular exercises, etc."
