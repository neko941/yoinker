        "I am writing this letter to bring your attention to a problem that I am facing pertaining to my current accommodation. I am Vishakha Trivedi, currently in the final year of the Pharmacy degree. I reside in Room 206 of hostel building \u2018C\u2019.  The room that I live in is shared with another student from my stream.",
        "My roommate and I have constant disputes over our lifestyle. I usually prefer to study in a quiet environment, whereas she prefers to party till late night. This is also affecting my sleep. As a result of this I am not able to concentrate on my studies. Moreover, she does not cooperate with me in tidying the apartment and keeping it clean. I have not received any positive response from her in spite of talking to her about this a number of times.",
        "I request you to transfer me to another apartment, preferably a single room, so that I can concentrate on my studies without any worries. Hoping to hear positively from you soon.",
