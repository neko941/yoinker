        "It is generally believed that businesses should focus on their revenue, and they should participate in everything which is profitable to them. In my opinion, they are kind of organisations which aim to make money. However, I also believe that, they should respect moral values and humanitarian principles in their policies and actions.",
        "Businesses are founded in order to generate income, and they take place in many fields from electronic gadgets to food products. Moreover, the society benefit from their wide range of productivity as well. Consequently, there is a clear mutual benefit in supporting profitable business. Furthermore, many business persons make donations to both governmental and non governmental organisations. In this way, the poor are receiving monetary aid and even complementary companies' products.  For example, ABC company profits from selling cleaning items and it helps Africa through providing appropriate infrastructural system and food.",
        "However, every sector is extremely competitive, and this might cause chaos and destruction in countries. In other words, companies may adopt illegal means to produce income to beat their rivals. It is not a secret that some renowned commercial organisations sell guns, military tanks and other necessary equipments to mostly third world countries. Thereby, they should act in accordance with the moral values and human rights and stop doing everything that is profitable to protect human lives especially children.",
        "In conclusion,  there is a common benefit in companies' generating revenue, because most of them are helping the unfortunate ones through certain organisations. I believe that, they should be able to do anything for obtaining profit with the exception of military equipments. In this way, social peace can be promoted automatically."
