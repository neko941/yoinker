        "It is a widely known fact that taking a year gap between the completion of schooling and before joining the university is famous nowadays. The advantages of this approach are where the skills can be improved and which can beneficial for the studies later. Lack of interest and getting misleading are added to the disadvantage side.",

In other words, by joining any voluntary work according to their talents will help them to groom their abilities and in the future, it would be an added advantage or credit to their college studies. For example, one can improve his or her knowledge and reading habit being a volunteer in a local library, as you will have access to a wide range of book collections.",
