        "Profitable occupation instead of job satisfaction is a controversial theme. A large number of people believe that a high salary is more importance than how people feel about their work. In this essay, I will extend my agreement about how crucial is job fulfilment.",
        "First of all, people feel more important when they have the opportunity to contribute via their occupation in society. For example, nurses and teachers are doing a high contribution job which gives them a sense of satisfaction. Furthermore, nowadays most of the people work long hour shifts as working time cover almost thirty per cent of the day. People spent a lot of hours in their workplace, for this reason, it should grow into a feeling of happiness and satisfaction. Moreover, if humans are employees an enjoyable job that can reduce the stress in their life and can lead to a healthy life. Many pieces of research have proved that many diseases in modern society are caused by stress.",
        "On the other hand, a well-paid occupation could help people to enjoy a wealthy and more entertaining life. For instance, they have an adequate amount of money to spend on holidays or to possess expensive products like big houses.",
        "In summary, the benefits like the sense of contribution, the fulfilment and the reducing stress level for work satisfaction outweigh the drawbacks like the wealthy lifestyle. In my point of view, it is more important for humankind to feel happy with their work than to earn a lot of money."
