        "Communication has shaped our world throughout the history by exchange of thoughts, culture, food and products. And with the advent of digital communication through the internet, the process has revolutionized such interactions between people through emails, social media and instant messaging. I strongly agree with the statement and in this essay I will highlight my opinion with examples.",
        "Firstly, digital communication has helped the world come closer. People from any part of the world can share their thoughts on social media or emails, therefore having an impact on the way we think about others. For example, the plight of ethnic groups across South Western part of China came to light from a small email from a human rights activist. Consequently, the strong view of the country for being the second largest economy quickly changed and the atrocities are now being shared and highlighted on all social media forums. In other words, people can now discuss and share their thoughts that influence millions through the internet and often leads to mass movements.",
        "Secondly, it has helped improve businesses across the globe. Emails, Whatsapp and Twitter, nowadays have become official way of communication for many firms. For example, about 30 percent of the customer complaints were swiftly handled by Airtel through their Twitter account, while about 50 percent of complaints were catered through emails. Such ways of interactions not only make the customers feel empowered, but also help many companies to improve their services. Consequently, mass communication through various apps and emails has changed the way people do business, thus making it more transparent.",
        "In conclusion, digital communications has positively changed the way we feel and think of the world. In other words, communication has now become a tool that makes people feel stronger and completed."
