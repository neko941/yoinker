        "To embark with, I am interested in doing a Master\u2019s in Public Health which is a one year course with thesis. Because I have completed my graduation in medicines in 2016, I thought that it is the most appropriate course to start a carrier as a researcher.",
        "What is more, I choose this college because this is the world's 5th ranked university producing thousands of competent graduates every year, who are working all over the world. In addition, I am also told by my cousin, who is an ex-student of the college, that professors are very devoted, loyal and faithful to their profession, and college provides state of the art facilities to their students.",
        "As another university in the town is offering me admission in the same course, but I will prefer your college to pursue my further studies. Therefore, If I am not eligible for admission, then I would not waste my academic year, as their deadline is approaching. I would like to request you kindly let me know at the earliest.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
