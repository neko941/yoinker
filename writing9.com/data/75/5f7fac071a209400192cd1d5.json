        "Globalisation and global environmental crisis make people  think deeply on every aspect of life where levy-paying is not an exception. Nowadays, due to the increased volume of a private wagon, some people think it is an imperative step that  authority should incline their duty and start using their money to provide better facilitate public commutation. Although, we all know that every coin has two sides which I am going to explain in further essay.",
        "There are numerous benefits to take heavy tax from private car owners. Firstly, It could be immensely helpful to control the global warming because if they have to pay more taxes then they will surely decline the use of a private automobile which would be beneficial to decrease noise as well as air pollution. Secondly, Public transport bus can carry more than 10 people which is helpful to lower down traffic problems and accidents as they are mostly done by rough driving of private cars users.",
        "On the other hand, there are many demerits of using public transport. To initiate with, sometimes because of fix schedule, one cannot reach his work on time particularly in small-town public commute has a low frequency of buses. Next, It is not suitable for office goers and professionals like doctors and nurses.For example, Doctors could not be able to make in case of emergency due to the prescribed schedule of buses which could possibly jeopardise others lives. Lastly, Privacy is not possible in public transport as it is one of the main factors for some people to choose a private car over trains and buses.",
        "In conclusion, the argument about raising the tax of private vehicle users apparently has some credibility. However, considering the negative effects, I firmly believe that it is not an ideal solution to reduce traffic problems."
