        "I cannot express my feeling enough that how much I enjoyed the meal. I did not know that your wife, Rita, is such a wonderful cook who can make various kind of mouth-watering dishes, especially the chicken curry which I will remember for long. Meeting with your grandparents was the highlight for me that reminded me the childhood time when I used to spend time with my grandfather.",
        "You may have noticed that I am always interested in passing time with your adorable kids. These two young people always catch my attention when I enter your house. They are not only gentle and cure, but also intelligent. You both are so fortunate to be blessed with the best gifts from the almighty.",
        "You know that the next Friday is a public holiday. Why don\u2019t you all come and see my new apartment? There is a spare room here, you can use this whenever you can. I am certainly not the best chef, but I am sure that I can offer you some delicious items and most importantly we will have an enjoyable time together if you finally manage to come. Please let me know if there is any special dietary requirement because I do not want you to go home poorly.",
