        "Many parents indeed spend a huge amount of money buying toys and electronic gadgets for their toddlers. While I accept that these toys can sometimes have a positive effect on the children, I believe that they are more likely to have a harmful impact. Over the course of this essay, I will discuss both the pros and cons of using a large number of toys on children.",
        "To begin with, the main benefit of buying numerous gadgets is that they enhance learning skills and understanding. Parents believe that by playing with interactive games, their teen can learn while playing. That is to say, with the advancement of technologies, there are a plethora of toys available in the market which can help their kids to interact and learn. For example, games such as scramble and word count, helps children to improve vocabulary as well as learning new ideas.",
        "Conversely, a large number of toys could cause physiological developmental issues as this can lead to many serious problems for the children such as reduced interaction with other kids. As a result, the child can become socially awkward. Moreover, teenagers can become stubborn and not understand the importance of things, and because of that, they can start breaking and losing toys carelessly, as they know that their parents will buy them more toys. Therefore, parents need to keep an eye on their juvenile and only provide them with things if that's a necessity.",
        "As you can see, there are potential advantages and disadvantages of providing a child with large amounts of toys.  While providing many toys allows for a greater opportunity for growth and development of skills, it also increases the risk of developmental issues in social interaction and attitude towards possessions.  In conclusion, I believe that providing an abundance of toys is more likely to be harmful than not."
