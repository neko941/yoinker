        "In these days, there are a lot of park, gym and mall together in a new city. A group of people believes that a government should build many park and gym in a city and it is really better them shopping malls. We think, public parks and sports can be important for them. In this essay, we want to express accept and disagree.",
        "First of all, public parks and sports can have a lot of advantages. Well, all people usually exercise every day and use public sports facilities. And also, children need parks and play there. In addition, these places can help them to be healthy and fresh. To illustrate, one recent study by British Americans scientist suggest that 90 percent of people need parks and sports and we cannot give them. In my opinion, we are able to live without shopping.",
        "On the other hand, a group of people prefer to go a shopping instead of park or gym. Moreover, they believe that should go a shopping every day and cannot live without it. Because of this, the government decides to make many malls and extend every day. For instance, in my city, the number of malls, are really more than public sports or parks. I think, the government earns enough money for shopping. So, they build malls more and more.",
        "In conclusion, a group of people attend to make many public parks and gym another group like to make shopping. We think, park and sports facilities can aid all people and become happy, but, build shopping mall do not need for all human."
