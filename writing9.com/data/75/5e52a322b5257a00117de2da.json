        "As a part of the government\u2019s fund is from the citizens of the nation who pay taxes, there is a need to understand the rudiments of good spending and bad spending. Although investments done in the arts may depict the culture of a country to some extent, I opine that the regime should focus on common people\u2019s welfare.",
        "Firstly, conducting art exhibitions and orchestras showcases our traditions to the outside world. In addition to that, it also encourages the artists to exhibit their talents and skills. Secondly, the filming industry pays government theatrical fees and entertainment tax. For example, a recent blockbuster movie in Bollywood had a greater response from the world audience, which resulted in twenty percentage profit to government through theatrical rights.",
        "However, people elected cabinet must be more inclined towards the public services like health and education which benefits the majority of the masses. They should have meticulously crafted plans which identifies the economically weaker section and provide them with education and health services at an affordable cost. The most significant duty of the government is to address the everyday issues faced by the public. For instance, there was a severe water scarcity in major cities due to deficit of rainfall in the year 2019.Because of this many restaurants and even hospitals were closed which impacted commoners. Government can curb this occurrence in the near future by investing in a rainwater harvesting system.",
        "To conclude, although the regime can contribute to the arts as it projects our heritage, I would re-iterate that the main responsibility of the government is to finance in hospitals, schools, electricity, transportation etcetera which reaches the public. I feel that is why the government is in place \u201cFor the People\u201d."
