        "Many people believe that zoos are of paramount importance in protecting wild animals, whereas others think that zoos should be shut down as locking up that animals in these places are cruel. This essay sheds light on both points of view and presents my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, there are manifold reasons why people believe zoos are beneficial. Firstly, due to the detrimental effects of global warming that are more likely to cause deforestation which deprived exotic animals of their natural habitat and food source, zoos, where provide shelter for them from under threat, are the ideal place. Moreover, zoos can preserve endangered animals which are on the verge of extinction and prevent them from poachers or wildlife traffickers. Secondly, by virtue of zoos, it allows people to gain deeper insight into the knowledge and awareness of different wildlife species from aquatic to terrestrial to volant animals.",
        "On the other hand, to begin with, zoos prevent animals from doing most of the things that are natural and important to them such as running or roaming. Being kept in cages, they may feel bored, cramped, deprived of freedom while they long for natural habitats. Thus, it can be regarded as passively killing the animals. Furthermore, in many zoos, animals are being mistreated as their top priority is profit. For instance, elephants are forced to paint the pictures with their trunks or lift up people to serve for entertaining for humans. Therefore, it is very easy for us to see the animals being underfed and poor living conditions.",
        "In conclusion, despite creating certain downsides, I believe that zoos are the appropriate place in terms of preserving endangered animals."
