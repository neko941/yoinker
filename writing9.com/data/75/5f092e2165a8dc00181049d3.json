        "In this technological era, people are becoming less dependent on books as a source of information and entertainment which in turn causes a loss in popularity of books. However, I believe that the importance of books in terms of providing knowledge and entertainment should never be underestimated.",
        "To begin with, the role of books to bring knowledge to humans are still of paramount importance. First, books are still enjoyed by a large number of people worldwide as a source of wisdom. In fact, thousands of books are printed every year to fulfil people\u2019s need of earning novel or in-depth knowledge. In addition, the fact that international bestsellers which are made into thousands of copies year by year for big readers around the world has shown that the burning desire of hunting after knowledge-packed books has never seemed to cease. Second, places where people hardly get access to the internet,  books are considered an optimal source to broaden their horizons. There is no denying that students attending remoted area schools where the Internet has hardly reached rely completely on books as the most compact and inexpensive means to facilitate their studies and therefore obtain more information.",
        "Another contributing factor is that there are still lots of people see reading as a pleasant diversion. First, more and more readers are enjoying the warm, personal experience of reading books. A recent study has shown that roughly 69% of people would rather choose to shut themselves up in a room and get their head buried in a good book than do some other forms of interpersonal entertainment such as playing sports. Second, with a diverse genres ranging from fiction books, educational, mysteries and suspense thrillers to self-help books, books can perfectly cater for personal preferences as a healthy pleasure source. As technology-fuelled pastimes are posing serious risks to people\u2019s health, more and more people have turned to books as a healthier way to entertain.",
        "In conclusion, although some claim that the demand for books as a source of information and entertainment has reduced considerably, I still have a strong belief that reading books is a great way to entertain and feed your mind with much-needed knowledge."
