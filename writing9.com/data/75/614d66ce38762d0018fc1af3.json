        "In this day and age, more and more people tend to opt for self-employment instead of working for corporations. Several reasons contribute to this phenomenon, and there are some drawbacks of being self-employed too, which will be discussed in this essay.",
        "The growing number of startups pertains to young entrepreneurs because of leading-edge technology, supportive government, and changing family attitudes. Business models and structures are now highly conducive to startups with the advancement of technology. That is to say, young people, these days, can solve our daily life issues with innovations with the help of cutting-edge technology. Likewise, today\u2019s governments are incredibly supportive of young entrepreneurs than ever before. The states are coming up with lucrative incentives to attract self-employment. Similarly, families, nowadays, encourage the young to be entrepreneurs and thus risk-taking appetite of youngsters has increased dramatically. A case in point is one of my school friends. She developed a boast machine when she was just 13. Her blog engine notched up huge gains, and her venture has become popular nationwide.",
        "However, like everything else on the earth, self-employment suffers from shortcomings. The most obvious one is the resources. In most cases, startup entrepreneurs embark on a business venture with a shoestring budget whereas their counterparts are well-resourced. It gives the rivals a competitive advantage in product development, marketing, and sales. They use this edge to flame out the nascent entrepreneurs when they pose threats. Take my case as an example. Despite cutting-edge features, one of my friends\u2019 ride-hailing app was eliminated due to Uber\u2019s advertising budget. Likewise, startup enterprises usually entail a high risk of failure. Functioning under such huge risks can blur an entrepreneur\u2019s strategic vision.",
        "To reiterate, self-employment is prevalent among the young of late. Several factors such as encouraging governments, emerging technology, and positive family outlook influence the youngsters\u2019 decisions. But every venture comes with some cons and the young should be aware of them."
