First, it will reduce time for applying a visa and people do not need to waste a lot of money for hiring a lawyer to process documents. On the other hand, people can choose the nation that best suitable for them and  this will bring happiness to every citizen. In addition, living in the new country requires people to learn new languages, which will extend knowledge of the population.",
