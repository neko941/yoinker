        "Everyone has their own mindset and way of thinking . However , some individuals claim that it is a good thing , not to change their routine and do the same things , others feel that alters in  daily growth is a good thing . In my opinion , it is  better to accept new challenges in  growth to make them more memorable.",
        "On the one hand , people are more comfortable  doing a same work . Although whatever they are pursuing now is according to their interest , they feel more lucky and happy while doing these activities .  For example , a student has an interest in science , he feels too good and comfortable to gain knowledge about that stream , he does not want any other subject to learn . In addition , they find it  a waste of time to do new activities . To illustrate, an employee who works in a company for 8 hours and after coming to the home they like to do work on the same project for their promotion or the creativity of the company . They think that if they do anything else , it will not beneficial for them .",
        "On the flip side , changing  a daily routine will improve the creativity and knowledge of people . Even though when a person is indulged in the same work , his knowledge is remained within that boundaries , when he starts doing other tasks , many and more ideas have collaborated in his mind and he can be able to grab more information . Moreover , changes make  life interesting and adventurous. When we are trying new tasks, it makes life amazing and makes us feel happy . For instance , when we are going to travel to a different area , we try a lot of different things which provides good memories and interest to fo them again .",
        "In conclusion , however , the daily routine might be flexible and simple , we have to try new things to collect interesting moments of life ."
