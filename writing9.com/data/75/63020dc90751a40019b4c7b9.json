        "Plastic use has significantly increased over the past decades, to an extent that we might struggle to pass a day without touching plastic. The use of this versatile material, though unavoidable, must be controlled. The ultra-convenience offered by this material has led us to throw it away just after one use. This is a major problem for the environment.",
        "Plastics predominantly disturb the land and water. They do not decay and do not bond well with soil, causing arable land to become useless. Further, tourist destinations do suffer due to poor disposal practices, damaging the most stunningly beautiful locations to become an eye sore. Plastic is a threat to marine life. The bottles, straws, and bags that float will block waterways and stop oxygen from dissolving into the water. These materials are foreign to the marine environment, and they interfere with water-living creatures like turtles. Nature activists report that over 30% of the deaths are due to the harmful effects of plastic.",
        "Exploring the potential solutions to mitigate the detrimental effects of plastic use, firstly, we should start with educating the general public because we people, in general, are sensible about saving the earth as a place for our children to live. Secondly, we should increase the opportunities to recycle plastic. Certainly, this will make some of us withhold disposable plastic and hand it over to the recycling centres. Germany is a well-known example of this, where shoppers are keen to return the plastic bottle in favour of the small refund they get. Thirdly, governments should impose a tax on plastic usage, making products manufactured using plastic costlier than those produced with alternative materials.",
        "In conclusion, plastic is a highly versatile material that provides a cost-effective solution for most manufactured goods. However, single-use plastic takes a toll on our environment, therefore, we should have a pragmatic approach when using plastic. Authorities and the general public should work together to reduce the harmful effects either by eliminating plastic use, substituting with less polluting materials, reusing plastic as much as possible, or disposing of them with minimum environmental impact."
