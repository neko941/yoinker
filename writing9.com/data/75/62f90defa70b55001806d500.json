        "These days, it is common among business owners to show their products as  new with some strategies in their commercial advertisements. In this essay, I will discuss why this trend is increasing and then outline my opinion as to why I think this development is negative.",
        "There are some reasons for this practice. One thing could be earning more money.What I mean by this is that when companies advertise their new products want to increase their sales.By advertising, more and more people know their products and believe, that special item is the one, which can meet their needs. For example, in Iran, most of the products which are sold by factories are  ones which are not new.As a result ,companies earn more and raise their sales.Another reason for this trend is competing with other business owners. Companies by introducing their new products try to get the market from their competitors. It can lead to an upward trend in their sales. For example, most companies, compare their products with other's products in their advertisements. It shows that their products have more benefits and persuade the consumers to buy them.Consequently,factory owners tend to advertise their new products as new and necessary items.",
        "This trend could have some negative effects on  societies.For one thing, consumerism can be mentioned. If business owners show their products as  new ones, it will cause a significant increase in buying the things that people really do not need. For instance,in Iran, most of the electronic devices which are shown as new ones in advertisements, are bought by people ,while they are not useful. For another , it is environmentally harmful. What I mean is that by purchasing more useless products  society produces more trash. As a result,the environment is more in danger. Subsequently, the whole trend has a negative impact on both the community and the environment.",
        "in conclusion, to reiterate this phenomenon stems from two reasons. One which is increasing sales for business owners and another one is getting the market. Nevertheless, it is my firm belief that the whole trend is a negative development as it could lead to consumerism and a more polluted environment. Should people and factory owners consider the drawbacks, the whole practice could be more beneficial for people and the environment."
