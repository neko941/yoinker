        "Corruption is a fact of the human species. Where there is a human, there is a crime. Furthermore, As the world is moving towards modernization the ratio of violation is less as compared to the previous version of the world. So, I tend to go along with that hi-technology results in low cases of violation.",
        "First and foremost,  crime can be divided into two categories. One is physical and the other is Online.For the physical violation, the modern technology used by an administration like in automobiles helps them to catch criminals within time. Moreover, we cannot ignore the role of cameras and computers which assist at the back end. Adding on, the devices used for communication by police are up-to-date. This allows communication without distortion and delay. For example, Dubai is claimed to be one of the safest cities because of the hi-tech devices being used by their patrol department. These include the fastest cars like Ferrari, Lamborghini and many more to catch criminals.",
        "Secondly, the next category is online robbery which includes money theft, data stealing and most of the important is hacking house surveillance devices. Money is transferred to another account or someone buys something online through a credit card. So, to prevent many codes having strong firewalls which are unable to access are being used. And this is because of the modernization in computers. For example, blackberry phones are considered one of the most protective phones because of the high-end security insured by them.",
        "Bringing this to an end, I reiterate that computerization has solved many of our problems and reducing the crime rate is one of them."
