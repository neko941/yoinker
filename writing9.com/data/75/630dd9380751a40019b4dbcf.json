        "Shopping habits vary from person to person. It is often argued that this is more related to the age group people belong to than to other factors. I partly agree with this opinion and believe that other factors can also result in the difference in people\u2019s shopping habits .",
        "On one hand, people\u2019s age certainly influences their shopping habits. For example, while teenagers tend to spend more money on fashionable clothing and electronic products, older people usually buy useful household goods. In addition, people of different generations also do shopping in various ways. Compared to the elderly, young people prefer purchasing things on the internet instead of shops and stores on the street.",
        "On the other hand, there are a lot more reasons for the diversity in shopping habits. One of the most substantial ones is the wealth gap. For instance, wealthy families are able to consume luxuries. However, earning limited income, people born in poor families have no choice but to save their money for necessities.",
        "In addition, cultural differences can affect the shopping habits of a person. This means that people who live in a certain place might develop  unique shopping preferences. While some people from western countries prefer consuming products, Asians are known for their love for real estate.",
        "In conclusion, although people\u2019s shopping preferences are influenced by the age group they belong to, there are several other factors that can not be neglected. Therefore, I am convinced that the reason for people's shopping habits is absolutely more complicated than just their age."
