        "The progress of a country in different ways is debatable. Most governments believe that improvement in the economy is their most important achievement. While Some argue that other improvements are equally important for a country's progress.  In this essay, I will discuss both arguments in detail and also I will give my opinion that why other types of progress are equally important for a country's overall improvement.",
        "First and foremost, economic progress is very essential for a country's development. The economy is like a backbone for any government because it is impossible for a country to be developed without a good economy. For example, the USA is superior in the whole world due to a stable and good economy. Moreover, a lot of  countries with the best economies are the strongest in the whole world. To sum up, a financially strong country can get a stable business market in the world and they can never be defeated by other countries.",
        "On the other hand, some other types of progress are also very important for the success of a country. Firstly, education plays a vital role in the development of a country. To illustrate, most countries will get an abrupt improvement by increasing their literacy percentage. A good education will provide many opportunities to people in the job market and also they can start many businesses which will automatically improve their country's value. Secondly, providing different skills to the citizens of a country will affect the overall progress of that country. For example, because of great skilful people, China is becoming a superpower in the whole world.",
        "In conclusion, this essay discussed both arguments in detail. In my opinion, a good economy can help a country's development but proving a good education and different skills to people will also play an equal role in a country's development."
