        "It is thought that some individuals have inborn skills like being a sports person or a musician while others are not born with such. Others opine that it can be learnt by being taught about it. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and state my opinion.",
        "First and foremost, many believe that any child can be a genius one. It is only about how much his parents are paying attention to his needs and what do they do to develop these hobbies. For example, a psychology professor agreed with his wife to raise their children as the books of development and psychology says, and now their daughter is the best chess player in the world.",
        "In my view, it all starts from home when a mother tries to show her baby various options and different areas of play and also he will identify the available components around him and try to discover his own interests. As the children grow up, they need continuous support and encouragement to keep his certain hobby, such as music, more developed. This will not happen without professional help to have the famous,  talented artist at the end. On the contrary, there is a common belief that many celebrities are famous because they were born with specific talents not because they were taught to practice these talents.",
        "To sum up, I strongly believe that either born talented or not, any person can be whatever he wants only by the continuous hard work and practice, not by genetics."
