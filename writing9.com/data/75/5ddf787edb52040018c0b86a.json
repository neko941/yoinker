        "The purpose of writing this letter to you is to draw your attention towards an important issue of unavailability of spacious parking space.",
        "On daily basis, I waste at least 25 minutes in finding space to park my car, because the current area to park cars is not enough to cater the need of 50 employees working in this company. Due to congested parking, I prefer to park my car 1km away in the city mall. I spend extra money to pay for a parking facility, while I have to walk for 30 minutes to reach the office.",
        "Both finding ample space and to park the car far away from the office is wastage of time. if we specify the extra place, it will be extremely helpful to resolve this issue. As per my knowledge, we can rent an area adjacent to the office, because by lending this space, it'll be more than enough space, to provide a place to park vehicles.",
        "Moreover, it will be beneficial for all employees. Because parking amenity will save a lot of time as well as blockage at arrival and departure timing of the office.",
