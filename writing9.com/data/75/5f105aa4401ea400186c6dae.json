        "Multiculturalism is a very debatable topic throughout the world in recent times. Many people think that a nation becomes more interesting, and it helps to develop faster, against the countries, which are not diverse. This essay will discuss why I believe that by having people from different background and culture not only help country to grow faster, but also it becomes more fun.",
        "There are two primary reasons why people from different background is far more advantageous. Firstly, if in a region people from different countries living together, it brings more convenience to all citizens in that country. In addition to this, these people will also bring their culture, food, clothes and many more other things with them. . For example, the country like Australia, people from over 50 countries live there, and recent survey conducted by government has shown that, by having more diversity among population, they tend to live a healthy life and able to live long. Because of the aforementioned reasons, I think people from around the world should promote multiculturalism in their nation.",
        "The secondary reason why I believe that open borders will help states to develop faster, because I think that immigrants from other nations will also bring their knowledge and creativity with them. For instance, Since India is considered as the IT hub of the world, the country like America is benefiting the most from it. So that, it is a very bad idea to consider having a single culture state.",
        "This essay discussed the two important reasons how people from different background can help the state develop faster. To conclude, I certainly think that multicultural society is far better than a single cultural society."
