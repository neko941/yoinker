        "In the present days, the act of committing crimes on roadways on a regular basis has caused several detrimental accidents to other drivers and pedestrians, which is believed that only the strict punishment would improve the situation. From my standpoint, I share the view that it is effective to put a heavy fine on the criminals, but there are still other methods which should be adopted by the authorities and also the individuals.",
        "On the one hand, a strict punishment to those violating the traffic laws is totally justifiable. This can be elucidated by when people are aware of the existence of strict traffic regulations, they will have a tendency to follow the rules properly due to the fear of receiving retribution such as ceasing the driving license, monetary fines and imprisonments. For instance, in 2007, the policy-makers in Vietnam had strongly introduced a rule that wearing helmets was mandatory to all motorcyclists and the offenders were charged from 10 to 15 USD each. As a result, the number of lethal road accidents eventually declined by 12.86%, which had not ever been seen before.",
        "On the other hand, as the existing severe penalties could not utterly ensure the road safety in a long term, more actions should be taken by the authorities and the public as well. One possible action should be that the government pour more budget into educational TV programs to aware people of the devastating consequences of traffic violation bringing to our lives. For example, if one driver involved in a crash were not wearing a helmet, the risk of suffering from traumatic brain injury or fatal death would be significantly high. In addition, as individuals, people should qualify a driving license at the age of 18 and make sure to be able to read the traffic signs with precision. In this case, people will become more alert and self-disciplined when using their personal vehicles.",
        "All summed up, the utilization of strict penalties for driving offenders help the government reduce a large number of road accidents recorded, however, it is not the sole solution. In my opinion, people\u2019s awareness of traffic rules plays a pivotal role in the community\u2019s security and driving licenses should be adopted by everyone."
