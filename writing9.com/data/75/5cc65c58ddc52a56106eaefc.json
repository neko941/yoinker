As such I must pass my sincerest apologies for any difficulties related to the extra work that must have been involved, and the time wasted on your behalf. Although the offer was substantial, it wasn\u2019t enough to encourage me to sever the bonds with my current employer. During my time at my present company my superiors supported me and fostered my career. In short, they made me the employee I am today.",
