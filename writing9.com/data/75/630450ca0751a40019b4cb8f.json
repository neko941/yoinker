        "At the present time, computers have been becoming a meaningful part of the educational field. The central theme of the essay is to find out some advantages and disadvantages. However, I am inclined to believe that people should try to keep a balance not to get several adverse consequences.",
        "To begin with, using computers has two main benefits related to education.  The system of computers can store important data such as a large number of files, documents, folders and etc. Teachers and students can easily hold there their presentations, tests and homework. For example, Google Documents or Microsoft Office provide people with a number of programs, where people can create tables, documents, presentations and stores there. Likewise, the second essential point is that computer system has been becoming a significant component of education as students have computer science subject. In this lesson, students learn how to work on computers, by doing so the situation forces schools to provide schoolchildren with computers.",
        "Notwithstanding that there are some advantages, computers include two main drawbacks. First of all, spending a long period of time in front of a monitor may cause an increasing number of illnesses. For instance, teenagers spend the bulk of their time at the computer, which can contribute to obesity, learning, attention, and sleep problems as kidhealth.org claims. Furthermore,",
        "To conclude, there are both advantages and disadvantages of computers in education, ,however I am convinced that society is able to use computers in the right way without any harm to themselves and other people."
