        "I am writing to do some inquiries about your conference center. My company ABC Inc. is holding a workshop on December 20th Friday at 10 am at your conference center.",
        "The training Is about developing healthy workplace practices and it would be for about 2 hours. I would be needing the Conference Room from around 9a am to 1pm. I would kindly request you to provide me with the needed equipment. The training would need a projector and 3 tables to keep at the centre of the conference room. This is for the hosts so that people can ask questions anytime. So please bear in mind that the location of these tables is important. The number of people attending this training would be close to 100 so I would need a room that would be able to hold these many number of people.",
        "Also, I had some questions about the facilities such as the elevators and entrance and exits. I would like to know how many elevators there are in the building and even the number of exits. It would be easier if we let batches of people out from different exits to avoid any chaos.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you.",
