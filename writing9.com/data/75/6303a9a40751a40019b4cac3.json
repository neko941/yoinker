        "Ever since civilization began, the size of human lives and settlements has widened over years around the world. With the increase in population size, people complain that society become problematic and chaotic to live in and I believe it is not less than agreeable.",
        "This is because, When more human lives exist, the world becomes too competitive and hard to survive as the share of space and resources becomes minimal. Thereby in order to survive people's practices are fights, robbery, scams, unfaithful relations, forgery, etc in order to make their livelihood. For example country like India where it consists the second largest population in the world, due to its huge population, many people were left unnoticed by covid infection and hence couldn't get medical aid which resulted in many death. Whereas though Bhutan is a less populated country, all the individuals residing in any nook and corner of the country received intense care and attention from not only the government but also from the highest authority, the King of the country. Further, overpopulation leads to the inclination of the unemployment rate, declination of resources, and hence increases the rate of poverty in a country.",
        "However, having less population can also repercurred in the loss of human capital in a country. Moreover, with less number of people in the country, it is actually risking the independence of the country as the country required human resources to fight and protect the country from another country. Like country Maldives, though the size of the country is smaller than Tibet, their human resources are more powerful than Tibet and hence remind independent.",
        "Nonetheless, having said that, in a nutshell, One can find that the larger the size of the population, the more social issues and challenges in lives.  Life gets sophisticated and competitive and gets dirtier in society."
