        "As an introduction, the commercial is crucial in persuading the public to purchase things. The successful key to advertising lies in the promotion strategy whether it is effective or non-effective and furthermore either by choosing the mainstream advertiser or the other way round.",

As an example, the broadcast is aired during  peak hour time, for instance  between the 8 p.m new broadcasting hence more people are watching and subsequently acknowledge with. This is what had been shared by our renowned successful low-cost airline \"Air Asia\" Chief Executive Officer, Tan Sri Tony Fernandes. Apart from television, Facebook, Tik Tok, Instagram and a certain specific app such as \" Grab\".",
        "When talking on Grab, without explaining in length everyone already knows about it. Why? This is because of the power of effective promotion via application technology.
