From my point of view, I believed that a healthy meal is one of the key factors that contribute to children\u2019s learning ability.",
        "The correlation between healthy eating habit and the productivity of study is obvious. If the children do not have enough energy, they are more likely to be distracted to the lesson or even be in a bad mood.

Additionally, the high-sugar and high-fat snacks should be replace of fruits or sorts of nutritional supplements to gain more benefits for the students.",
        "It is schools and parents that response to supply the balanced diet for children. As a result, schools should have some strategies in order to support the total development of children, not only facilities and education but also a good meal. In addition, it is necessary for parents to have a healthy nutrition for kids in associate with classifying the impact of that to the children's lives.",
