        "It is considered by some that reading resources on an internet are merely beneficial for juvenile\u2019s learning skills, whilst other people think that pressed materials are better for learning skills.  In my opinion, I believe that online sources are pretty useful for studying. This essay will discuss both points of views.",
        "It is clear that there could be several beneficial factors, however, the main profits are saving both time and money for parents. Books can be pretty expensive and not affordable for everyone. I believe that everyone has a right to access knowledge. Moreover, learning online give a chance to have free time. The International Children\u2019s Digital Library is a prime example, where many can easily access novel stories and in-depth knowledge without wasting both of their money and time.",
        "On the other hand, although there are helpful opportunities on the computer, however, there are also drawbacks. The greatest demerit is that can damage significantly child\u2019s body structure, especially their eyes\u2019 health after once in a while. When we stand in front of the computer for a long time, after a while because of bad posture their spine bends. Furthermore, looking at the screen for a long time their eyes side weakened. For instance, approximately three years ago, my cousin had an operation on his eyes. Despite past three years of the operations, he is not still utilizing online materials because of his doctor\u2019s recommendation.",
        "In conclusion, while the internet gives a chance to gain cutting-edge study skills to juveniles,  it deteriorates child\u2019s development of the body. However, I fully believe that the technology sources are more favourable aspects of both money and time."
