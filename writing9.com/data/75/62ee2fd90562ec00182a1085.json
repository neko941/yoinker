        "There are numerous ways for the young generation to equip themselves with knowledge. Some people may suppose that young people are currently utilizing books or movies for their study rather than getting real-life experiences. From my perspective, I agree that books or movies are universal methods of learning among the young, but I am more convinced that this generation is still getting more knowledge by experiencing their own stories.",
        "On the one hand, it is undeniable that young people are getting a broad understanding by reading books or watching movies. Firstly, books nowadays have been massively published much more than ever, and rapidly becoming affordable and convenient for everyone; at the same time, thanks to the wide Internet accessibility, movie platforms such as Netflix are commonly used among the young. Therefore, they can easily approach books or films and conveniently acquire knowledge from there. Moreover, the content of books and movies is vivid with colourful illustrations with a wide range of topics, which encourage young people to learn in an exciting and inspiring way. Besides, learning via books and movies is more time-saving compared to first-hand experiences, when the young can learn numerous subjects in a particular period if they make an effort.",
        "On the other hand, I am of the opinion that the young are updating their knowledge by getting real-life experience. First of all, more and more young people are aware of the importance of hands-on working experience rather than theoretical knowledge at school, so they tend to shorten their studying time at university and start their career path at young ages. In particular, many students may find internship opportunities or part-time jobs during their hours at university to equip necessary on-job knowledge and skills to be ready for their long-term career, instead of just spending their whole time on books or other channels. Besides, the young nowadays are proactive and sociable, when they usually establish various clubs or organizations, so that they can build their network with others who share the same hobbies and goals. Therefore, they can learn practical know-how from each other rather than just depending on books or movies.",
        "To summarize, reading books or watching movies are common methods among the young generation to learn knowledge, but I strongly agree with the idea that they are learning from real-life experience rather than books or movies"
