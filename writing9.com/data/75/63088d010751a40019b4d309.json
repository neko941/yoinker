        "In present days the number of youngsters quitting their educational program at the department is getting being raised. Consequently, this affects the community to a high extent such as an expansion of an unoccupied society. In my ,opinion this kind of situation can be solved by giving motivation to admission by enrolling them to free exam preparation classes and courses along with assuring the provident of an interesting social movement for all enlistment during their syllabus.",
        "Firstly , subjects  taught in the academy are often boring and many studies are not so crucial for their future lives, so courses and subjects which are helpful for their future college acceptance should be conducted.For instance, if someone wants to be  a doctor , he or she should already start taking medicine-oriented subjects such as chemistry, and biology on a frequent basis even totally all the study period. This will give people transparent imagination and confidence for their prospective pre-entry exams to their preferable major degrees. Therefore, boring and extra out of their interesting educational program would not challenge them to dropping from their institute.",
        "Secondly, most of the students at schools are forced only to study hard by receiving  excess  pressure either from their parents or teachers,however ,this can be eliminated if social activities are organised at their school places.For example, when I had been studying at high school , our director often organised social events and varied sports, musicals, barbecue activities and even a disco  every Saturday. Moreover, parties are welcomed in our school life as long as a student's study performance is good enough. These factors would definitely boost the eagerness of the population to study and  complete their studies at their schools.Thus,students will go to their schools excited and with enthusiasm because life-study  balance is crucial for advanced performance at school.",
        "To sum up, boredom at school is getting to be  a real problem, while the majority of students are dropping out of their school studies. So, introducing new policies such as teaching future major focused subjects for passing entry exams to college or universities instead of taking boring not needed for future lives classes and providing social life such as interesting sports events and competitions along with disco and parties will motivate persons not to stop their studies at schools. If students go to  school  knowing that it is an interesting place to study useful and needed courses and having involved in social activities with their classmates , nobody will stop studying at their study places."
