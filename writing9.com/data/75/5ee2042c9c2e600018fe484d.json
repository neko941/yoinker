A part of the human\u2019s comment is that such invention is the most important of the last hundred years. In further paragraphs, I will put forward my opinions followed by relevant examples.",
        "To begin with, there are many benefits of data processors. Firstly, it provides information around us or even the globe. With the development from day to day, scientists have used such appliances of high technology for their research. For instance, these days climate change is a crucial issue that imposes science must discover the solutions to solve. Therefore, the estimator is an authoritative machine that could dive into the ocean for thousand kilometres or approaches the volcano eruption. If an information processing system does not exist, this research will not possible.",
        "Moreover, estimator helps people with entertainment. After a hard day of working, we can relax with many interesting games. In leisure-time,  we also improve our knowledge from studying website. Besides, we could make friends or communicate with our relatives who live far from home to adopt reckoner. In contrast, the invention of the information processing system, contributes a lot of advantages for human life and the world.",
