        "In most parts of the community , the age of  marriage  is after  30 years rather than the twenties , which was practised previously. However ,this new development has positive facts like a good platform for starting family life and a good environment for improving the  lateral carrier like a job . Hence , this writer is in complete agreement with the statement that  the get married around 30y will help  society .",
        "To begin with , when we consider  society , most of the communities in the developing nations practise underage marriage . Unfortunately , most of these young couples do not have a big idea about  life and they stagnate their life with a vast amount of unaffordable  responsibilities at a young age . As a result , there are multiple family conflicts and most of them are separated after a  very limited married life . For instance , one of the research published in Sri Lankan university has shown, about 50% of couples ,who got married before their  thirties  will separate within 1y of marriage .",
        "At the same time , when someone gets married after their thirties , they will have a good time engaging in other  activities like education and occupation .Furthermore , They can spend much attention on their  work-related commitments and they get a chance to be promoted in their job . For example , according to the report published by the central bank of Sri Lanka in 2021 , most of the  young executives in the private and public sectors were unmarried up to 30years , compare to their counterparts who are married in their twenties, still in the preliminary stage of their carrier .",
        "In conclusion , there is a trend among young generations to  get married after their thirties instead of the twenties and below. This will give them a chance to fulfil their career success, as well as ,this will lead to  good marriage life . Since then,  this writer is in complete agreement with the fact that the practice of  marriage in the thirties  will help  society in a positive way ."
