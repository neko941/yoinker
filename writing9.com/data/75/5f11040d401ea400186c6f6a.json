        "Social networking sites have become immensely popular among all age groups in the last decade. There has been mixed opinion about its impact on our day-to-day life and society as well. I feel that these platforms have had a more positive impact than a negative impact. This essay will discuss in detail how these platforms are helping people to stay connected with each other and also how they play a major role in marketing.",
        "As the name implies, all social media platforms allow us to socialize with our friends and family over the internet. In particular, people can stay connected with each other through text messages, pictures, or even by sharing funny videos. This has hugely benefited individuals as they can share their joy, emotions, and even overcome difficulties if any. For example, people share their excitement in the form of images of their recent visits to places and receive plenty of likes and/or comments from their friends.",
        "Nowadays, social networking sites are playing a major role in marketing as these websites provide an option to buy and sell products. We can also rent houses, bikes, books and so on using their features. For instance, any student who wishes to study abroad can quickly access these websites to find accommodation nearby to his university. Similarly, they can also post ads if they want to furnish or sell any items.",
        "To conclude, with the advancement in technology, there are different forms of social media available now and have impacted the world. In my opinion, the introduction of these media to the public has brought a lot of positives to both individuals and society."
