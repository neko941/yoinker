With strong lighting effects on the advertisements, it may have detrimental impacts on drivers, citizens and pedestrian alike. Another major cause is waring signs on roads and streets, as cities have a higher car accident rate compared to town and village, it is necessary for governments and authorities to put warning signs on and avoid more casualties. However, these signs reported by the driver will reflect light during raining day and cause further accidents.",

Not only drivers on highway, but also citizens live nearby the building or skyscraper will harm their eyes easily because the lighting pollution. Furthermore, members of the city rarely have an opportunity to appreciate the stars and the planets since only the brightest celestial objects are visible.
