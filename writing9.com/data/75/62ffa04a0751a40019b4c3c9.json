        "Since science and technology in medicine have advanced, a huge number of people want to have a better look.The advantages of cosmetic surgery are to help people who have had accidents or who have had flaws in the body, but this trend has a negative impact on society in the sense that some people abuse plastic surgery and even might harm themselves.",
        "To begin with, the main reason is still somewhat dangerous. Accidents do happen and sometimes people look strange or ugly after their surgery. Some people mostly overuse this method and even face more health problems in the future. They misuse it to the point where they routinely do surgeries without a doctor's advice. Moreover, they will do plastic surgery in poor quality facilities if they don\u2019t have enough economic conditions. Consequently, their bodies are severely disfigured. For example, The girl used to have a normal appearance, but after many surgeries, she always worried about her health and her face can be disfigured anytime by negative effects.",
        "Cosmetic surgery is popular partly because they want their appearance to look prettier and  be appreciated by others. These days, a group of people promotes the idea that image is everything. They believe that only surgery can help them reach beauty standards. For instance, in Korea, plenty of individuals are going under eyelid surgery or nose jobs. They even work overtime to save enough money for such procedures just to look like their highly appreciated idols.",
        "In conclusion,misuse of cosmetic surgery has many disadvantages. But the necessary surgery helps people bring an individual's appearance from abnormal to normal."
