        "In our today's world travelling is a widely common action in almost all countries and has become a part of our lives.Well, in my opinion, there is undoubtedly a variety of justifications for this. I suppose I would say that the travelling issue has many significant causes.",
        "The first and foremost cause is to make business. At the present , a time for example many travel domestic or international to attend meetings for dealing with current or potential customers.Therefore they can make money as a first benefit. They also take part in exhibits to explore new trends, goods or technologies. Through assorted ,seminars whether business people or professionals like doctors, dentists, or engineers have a chance to gather knowledge from others. As a result, this is the most beneficial part of business travelling.",
        "At the same time, a secondary motive could be that  people travel for vacations. Of ,course this is more funny and enthusiastic . It is also a useful opportunity to be aware of different cultures and lifestyles. Last but not least the facilities that make travelling easier are getting developed day by day. Aeroplanes, see transportation vehicles and high-speed trains are the main players hence fair prices are affordable. People who desire to recognize other civilizations need only get search on the internet and then buy tickets to transport and make an online reservation for accommodation. So it could be the spice of travellers life.By the ,way the internet is a great tool supporting travel issues.",
        "In conclusion, when everything is taken into consideration travelling is a both beneficial and pleasant activity. Regardless of the borderless global ,world it would be getting more popular every day"
