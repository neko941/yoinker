I am writing for two main reasons, first I invited some of my friends over to a party on the weekend in order to celebrate my first single apartment in the city and considering that I am your next-door neighbour, I needed to assure that the noise will not be a problem. It will be a small gathering, but we will have music, food and beverages so it is very likely to get a little bit loud.",
        "Second, I would appreciate if you could come, not just to prevent the issue with loud music but it could be a nice occasion to get to know each other as we will probably be neighbours for a while. There will be plenty of food and if in the end,you decide to come, you only have to bring something to drink, alcoholic or not, it does not matter.",
