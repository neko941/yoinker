        "Few folks thought that a sense of rivalry in youngsters must be motivated.Remaining trust that the little ones who are educated to help each other as compared to oppose their mates develop themselves into beneficial adults.",
        "First of all, the supporters of the idea that the humour of opposition should  cheer up  students believe in the nourishment of small brains because when different learners are given a particular task in a competitive environment they would be able to perform even better consequences as compared to others.Apart from that, this exercise gives a chance to flourish their thoughts and strengthens mental capabilities too. For example, take the experiment held at  Howard University, which states students performing in a rivalry ecosystem provide better results  compared with those who are learning alone.Hence proved from the above discussion it is crucial for the youngsters to work in a group environment.",
        "Secondly, the advocates of the idea youngsters must supply sufficient assistance to partners rather than oppose their mates as a result they thought to become more successful citizens.Moreover, if the sense of conflict is no more present in the adults their intentions towards the public are good.Furthermore, another merit of this initiative is that the society booms in terms of every field regarding related to engineering,medical, and design when everyone is able to assist folks the ecosystem works well.For instance, the survey conducted in the Norway states in helpful surroundings there is a huge rise in the country's economy.",
        "As far as my opinion is concerned, my perception goes with the latter approach discussed in the above paragraph because ,on the contrary,  assistance is always needed in every department of the nation that's why I am going to support described idea this will lead to benefit both nation and persons too.",
        "To conclude, both views are correct in encouraging learners to compete with each other and provide assistance to others."
