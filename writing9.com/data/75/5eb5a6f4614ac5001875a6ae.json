        "Some parents are of the opinion that children should be taught about how to grow food and cooking from their teachers. I think this kind of encouragement will bring immense benefits in terms of health and skills. This essay will discuss the reasons behind such need and its benefits for the children.",
        "To begin with, I think in today's world, children are more fascinated towards fast food and unhealthy food due to its availability in diverse options such as Italian, Chinese, Spanish cuisine, etc. And at the nearest store these reasons really make them attracted towards these unhealthy meals. Hence, it gives birth to many diseases like obesity, blood pressure and so on. To protect this generation, growing food and cooking it by themselves is the best way to persuade them towards healthy and hygienic food.",
        "Furthermore, when children grow food by themselves they would know about the nutritional value of every food and how these food play an important role in their physical and mental growth. Moreover, when children teach how to grow food, it gives them inner satisfaction and play an important role to protect the environment. Children develop many skills by cooking food like it brings discipline, manners, food etiquettes and their scope of knowledge in food. Besides this, children also become more creative as they use their innovative ideas to make the dish more delicious and well presented. For example, there are many cooking shows like master chef junior telecasted on TV and the internet which motivate their hard work and develop their skills in this field. Therefore, this kind of involvement of children will only not develop their skills, but also nurture them in healthy lifestyle with their own innovative dishes.",
        "In conclusion, parents and teacher both come forward and encourage their children towards this activity as it brings holistic development with them and protect them from any health issues."
