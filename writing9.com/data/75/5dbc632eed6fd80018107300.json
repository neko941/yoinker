        "Television channels and newspapers use images while covering a news story. Some people believe that pictures have more impact as compared to words. Most of the news, when accompanied by photographs have more impact and become more understandable by the public. This essay will elaborate more on the effect of picture in the news media followed by my opinion.",
        "Firstly, when a television channel airs a news report and does not use any pictures or visual aid to prove it, there are chances of it being considered as fake. People will doubt the credibility of the news being aired. So is the case with the newspapers. If they an publish an edition without pictures, public would not prefer reading it as it not effective just with words. Many a times, many editorials with visual content fail to attract readers or viewers even after covering report with detailed information.",
        "On the contrary, when a news story is accompanied by pictures, it attracts more viewers or readers. In fact, they understand the message or a story better. With suitable evidence in the form of pictures, people believe the news report being covered by a television channel or newspaper edition. For instance, newspapers prefer to publish readers' or citizens' complaints related to public facilities with photographs as they communicate effectively and many a times forced the authorities to take appropriate action.",
        "To conclude, I strongly believe that pictures speak more than words and must be used by different media to cover various stories."
