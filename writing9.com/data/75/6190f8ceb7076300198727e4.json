        "I am very excited about your decision to improve your  English language and you need my advice on how to to choose a good language school, it is really the right step you have chosen.",
        "I will recommend a very nice language school in the city capital near the state library. The school is a unique one in that it is very big and has a lot of professional English teachers that are well trained.",
        "Their teaching method is out of this world, they impact knowledge and skills on their students with a lot of practicals, and also online training. But I will advise you to enrol on the physical class  lectures  to enable you to gain more in the courses and the hands-on-deck practicals as you have not studied at a language school before. The educators are very friendly and  their approach will help you feel at home as you learn.  The institution usually have a number of 20 admissions in each class to avoid over-crowd and make the students learn better. The English course is 2 hours per day which makes it 10 hours of learning  in a week, in order to make the learners learn at their pace and with great understanding.",
        "In conclusion, I will recommend the school because they are known for producing exceptional students in the English language.",
