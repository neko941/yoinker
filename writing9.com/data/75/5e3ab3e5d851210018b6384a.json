        "More and more fruit and vegetables are imported from some countries to nations where they are not available by air. This essay will first suggest that fresh fruit for the whole year is the primary benefit of this while price increasing is the main drawback.",
        "The main reason those products are imported to countries where they are impossible to grow is because consumers can have a chance to eat fresh products every time. Fresh crops cannot be stored for a long time unless they are frozen. Air transport, which is the fastest way to import them, is the only way to keep them fresh during the travelling time between two countries. For example, North America\u2019s temperature is usually below 0 degree Celsius for almost 8 months every year, hence 80% of fresh harvest here are imported from South America where they can be grown easier.",
        "Despite this benefit, the high cost of those products is the disadvantage of air transport. This increasing comes from the air\u2019s expense and the tax between countries. Because fruit and vegetables are not the last-long products, people cannot reduce the price of transportation by using the cheaper one such as ship transport or train transportation. For instance, Vietnamese\u2019s durian, which is sold in Chinese supermarket in Canada, always has 10 times higher price than that in Vietnam due to the transportation\u2019s fee.",
        "In conclusion, air transport may bring the freshest products to consumers in nations where they are impossible to grow, but the high cost of those can be a main reason to prevent people buying them."
