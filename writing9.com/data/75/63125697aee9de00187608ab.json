        "Being happy is a crucial goal in people\u2019s lives. There are various reasons why it\u2019s hard to have an acceptable definition of happiness. There are also many factors for us to gain happiness in our lives.",
        "Defining happiness is hard due to various things. First, people have different tastes in their lives. For instance, while some people find happiness in their leisure time, others prefer to work to be happy. Another example is that some prefer to be with their friends and their families most of the time, and some prefer to be alone mostly. Secondly, the way people consider themselves happy in different cultures is different. To illustrate, in religious countries and cultures, people are happy for doing good things that lead them to eternal salvation, but in contrast, nonreligious people mostly find happiness at the moment they live in, not in the afterlife.",
        "There are various important aspects to consider for achieving happiness. First and most important is to find out what makes us happy in our lives, and then try to achieve it. For instance, some may find happiness in getting retired soon and spend the rest of their lives travelling and visiting all around the world. Conversely, other people may consider happiness as loving their work and having a good career. We can pursue whatever makes us happy in our lives and be happier people than before. Second, we should control not having high expectations from ourselves. If we have unreasonable expectations from our lives, we will have a sense of insufficiency, and with this mindset, we won\u2019t achieve happiness very easily.",
        "To sum up, happiness is an important concept for mankind. The reasons why it\u2019s hard to define are illustrated, and some factors in achieving happiness were suggested."
