        "Following the advancement of technology, the digital libraries and online database have become the main resources for people to get information. Some people suggest that it is unnecessary to run a library nowadays, while others argue that it still plays a vital role in the community. From my perspective, I agree with the latter viewpoints for several reasons, which will be further discussed and elaborated in this essay.",
        "To begin with, collecting books is not the only functionality of a library, it also provides an undisturbed space for people to study or holds a wide variety of activities for the community. For instance, conducting the reunion of readers or the play group of young children, this enables the local residents to get familiar with each other as well as strengthening the bond between individuals and the community. Accordingly, libraries have become one of important places of social interaction, not solely borrowing books and attaining knowledge.",
        "Besides that, the fact is that not everyone has the capacity to access the digital libraries or online database, although they are considered as the minority to the society. Take the old generation as an example, most of elders are not accustomed to the latest technology such as computers or the internet, the traditional library is the only way for them to obtain information. Moreover, with the assistance of librarians, those print-only books and historical materials would be preserved properly, and also populaces can acquire the guidance about the content of books. Consequently, the libraries are still in demand for people in general.",
        "In conclusion, the existence of the libraries guarantee that everyone has the same accessibility to broaden their insight and wisdom. Therefore, it is crystal clear to me that the libraries still possess the same importance with multi-function as the olden days."
