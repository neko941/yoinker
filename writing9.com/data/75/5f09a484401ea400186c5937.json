Other employers see no benefit in doing so. Consider the arguments from both aspects of this possible debate, and reach a conclusion.",

        "A huge number of organizations offer their staff subsidised membership of the gym and sports clubs because they believe that it will make their staff healthier and more productive at work. Whereas, some employers say that providing such amenities will not bring benefits to the company. This essay will argue both points in detail followed by a conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, it is proven by experts that providing such facilities to employees will bring numerous benefits to the organization. To elucidate, for many companies, employees' health is more important than anything else as they treat them as a family member. Also, hitting a gym or playing other sports activities will maintain employees' health. As a result, employees will feel motivated at work. Even though, an increasing number of workers switch their jobs in a short time, as we see today in Dubai. If employees are entitled to other facilities like gym, sports clubs, and others then it is less likely that they change jobs very quickly. For example, according to a survey, which reveals that employees who are given such options wherein they can utilize their leisure time in sports activities or gym are proven to be more productive at work as well as less likely to leave the organization.",
        "Conversely, it is argued by some employers that investing money in activities like gymnasium, sports clubs, swimming pools, and others could put the company's finance department in difficult circumstances as they do not see any outcome. Besides, they encourage their staff to participate in other programs wherein they get a chance to improve their skills which could be beneficial for the organization. For instance, last year one of the best software companies in Abu Dhabi signed a contract with Microsoft company so that their workers can take pieces of training on new software programming languages. Thus, that company's portfolio is so strong as it got many tenders worldwide.",
        "To sum up, both points have their significance. Companies should take initiatives to provide as many benefits as possible to the employees because their satisfaction is key to companies' success."
