        "Beyond a shadow of doubt, several celebrities should be accountable for their actions. Because with great power comes a great deal of responsibility.I completely stand for this statement, let us discuss why.",
        "Firstly, we live in a very tech savvy world where everything around us is documented. Even though we try to protect out private lives, it's very uncertain.For instance, when film stars or super stars lead as a brand ambassador for a particular product, his or her fans without a doubt in their mind would purchase the particular product. Whereas, if an ordinary person markets or endorses a product not many folks would be that interested to own it.Thus, it is so essential for people in the spotlight do the right things and be a good role model.",
        "Secondly, people are only humans and we all tend to make mistakes. The top end clients cannot always be a perfectionist. Though they are celebs, they are common people just like us at heart mind and soul. To illustrate with an example, critics are all around the clock want to invade their private lives and wait for a moment to see them fail. In order to increase their TRP rating they may give out fake news and accuse the celebrities. The paparazzi is the worst, as they invade the privacy of the people like no other can.",
        "To summarize, I consent that human begins who are famous should take the ownership to set a good example,However, not in a way that they are pressured to do so. We as individuals should be able to stand by one another in sickness and in health, in trouble and sorrow, also in good times as well as bad. Unless our hearts are pure, we can never see the goodness in others."
