        "There is currently a contentious argument over whether in the next years, tourists will prefer to stay at their country to enjoy their leisure time to going to a different nation. I agree with this opinion since economic aspects as well as sanitary measures has been changing tourists' behaviour in recent times.",
        "The main reason I believe that tourists will rather stay in their country is due to economic factors. It is known that is becoming costly travelling abroad, which involves especially destinations such as France, England to name but a few, due to the dollar fluctuation, that is the commercial currency for world business. Therefore, people are enticed to have domestic trips instead of international ones. To illustrate, a good example is a Brazilian currency that is real, which is considerable week in comparison to the dollar, which means that Brazilians resort to local trips in order to save money.",
        "Another reason why I support the notion that domestic travels are an underlying trend is that it is safer. As the contemporary world is tackling some health measures to deal with the COVID-19, which is a virus that brought about the current pandemic situation, most of the countries are closing borders to foreigns that intend to travel for leisure purposes. Thus, it is believed that this situation will not change even if the vaccine works one hundred per cent, which means that will take several months or years to guarantee that all individuals are in good conditions to resort to travelling abroad. For instance, borders in The United States recently were closed for a second time for all flights coming from England because of the new variation of the virus.",
        "In conclusion, I agree that travelling abroad has been avoided for most of people. The main reason is owing to economic factors and also because of health conditions. Given this situation, I feel that this scenario calls for a long time until the wold come to normal circumstances again."
