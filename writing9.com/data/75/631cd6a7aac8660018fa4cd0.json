        "We are residents of Forest Avenue and writing a letter to highlight some issues related to the rubbish or waste collection system in our area.",
        "It is worth  mentioning that the automatic waste collection equipment is not working properly. While gathering the garbage, the bin usually lifts by the roller fitted with the vehicle. However, during the process, so much wastes spread on the ground and it is not cleaned later by any person.",
        "As a result, it creates badly smell and the area becomes too dirty and unhealthy. The insects are found everywhere. Hence, we have been frequently getting sick. Furthermore, the community in our area  can not go for walk in the evening and due to last week's heavy rain, the situation gets worst and unhygienic.",
        "Although there are a plethora of suggestions, we would like to recommend some effective solutions such that replacing the vehicle's roller system with an advanced truck already being used by Council in the city area which is having  three rollers to pick up the bin easily without any spill.",
        "We are looking forward to taking the necessary action at your end to solve the difficulties in our area.",
