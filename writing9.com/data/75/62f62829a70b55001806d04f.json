        "I am writing to complain about a new color TV set bought from the Max shopping mall.",
        "I bought this Samsam color TV set yesterday at the Max shopping mall. The shopping assistant guaranteed that this TV set has a high-quality screen. However, when I turned on the TV at home, the lightness of the screen cannot be adjusted. The screen is too dim to see clearly. I called the shopping mall right away, and the staff offered to repair the TV set. The engineer came and took the TV back to the store. The engineer called me late today, and he said there was a broken part in the TV set. It will take at least one week to solve the problem.",
