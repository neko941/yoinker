        "It is ambiguous whether machines will take-away the human workforce entirely. While it is possible that labour-intensive tasks and one demanding a high level of accuracy will be gradually taken up by robots, it is unlikely that the jobs requiring brain power will be taken over. In my view few tasks will still  be carried out manually.",
        "To begin with, all machines have their own limits, and artificially intelligent robots are not an exception. For instance, robots  may become adapted to  carry out  complex jobs, but it will require humans to regulate their intelligence. Secondly, if at all robots develop emotions or sense of feelings they may not sound pleasing or appealing like humans. For instance, babies may dislike robotic babysitter or for a patient the new electronic nurse may appear dumb and boring which could impact recovery rate.  Last but not least, the robots may evolve similar to humans, but it seems they may not be welcomed and indeed suitable for some jobs.",
        "Moreover, despite of their ability to perform well in various production sectors, it would not be feasible for robots to take-up humans in the realms demanding mental abilities, especially: testing edible items, perfumes, ability to debate or perform research work and so on. For example, to develop a new flavour it will not be possible for robots to decide on final taste also, they may stand ineffective as a lecturer. What is more, the robots may emerge as a potential threat to their very inventors, evaluating those risks  some level of manual command will be mandatory to inspect or regulate their performance.",
        "To conclude, though it appears that the utility of robots will increase significantly, I believe that  the interference of humans will be mandatory to overcome their limitations. Consequently, few jobs will continue to be dominated by the humans undoubtedly."
