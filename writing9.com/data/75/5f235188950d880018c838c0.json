        "There has been a diverse range of fatal as well as trivial illnesses all over the world. Due to the financial burden that researching and treating them imposes on the individuals and the healthcare system, it is better to prevent them from occurring in the first place rather than curing them afterward. I strongly agree with this and opine that disease prevention should be given more priority than researching and treating it subsequently as it is more economical and time-saving.",
        "Some diseases can be more economically prevented than treated. This means that taking adequate precautionary measures against them can efficiently protect an individual from catching them. Besides, these relevant steps also alleviate the economic burden on the people in general as well as the health care system, which the research and treatment of these diseases would impose on them. For example, HIV which causes AIDS can be easily prevented by wearing condoms, which are relatively cheaper as compared to the antiviral treatment that is given for AIDS afterward. Therefore, it is better to prevent a disease primarily, rather than researching and treating it afterward because the preventive measures are much less costly.",
        "Secondly, the prevention of certain diseases is easier and less time-consuming than researching and treating the illness per se. Sometimes, research on a particular malady takes years and years before giving any productive results and conclusion, while the people keep suffering and dying of the illness. For instance, the Coronavirus, which has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, has already caused millions of death worldwide. However, researches are still being conducted by doctors all over the world, to invent a vaccine while people continue to die of it. This means that had the people taken adequate measures to prevent it, which are as easy as wearing a face mask and maintaining social distancing, the mortality rate would have been much lower. Thus, some diseases can be more conveniently prevented than being researched or treated and the government should educate the masses in this regard.",
        "To conclude, the prevention of diseases and infections is indeed better than curing them. I strongly agree with this and reckon that the preliminary steps taken to avoid them are more cost-effective and feasible than spending years and years on the researches and treatment of these ailments."
