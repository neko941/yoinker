        "I am glad to see your letter after a long time.  Since I have been busy with my hectic job, couldn't contact you any sooner. I know that you are a little worried and confused about what could be the best option for you, whether to join a college or find a job.",
        "First, I think you should find some work since your family is in crisis after your dad\u2019s retirement and because there is no one to support your family in this situation. You are a grown and responsible person, hence the family expects a lot from you.",
        "Furthermore, if you join college in such a distressing situation, I am sure you would not be able to take pleasure from it. Therefore, getting suitable work is a need of the hour and while doing so you will get satisfaction to support your family. For example. When you start working in a particular company you can aim two things like you will be not just able to support your family, but also save up some money to join university next year.",
        "Needless to say, you are truly excellent in communication skills, so a sales and marketing job will be a great option for you. You will do justice to it and you will soon get promoted too.",
        "I wish you all the best and hope to hear from you soon, don\u2019t forget to keep in touch.",
        "Take care and pass my regards to your parents.",
