        "In many countries, they tend to use a common language and that is the English language. Almost every country, people is using English apart from their native language. Some people and include I think that the life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world.",
        "Firstly, using common language is having a plenty of advantages, such as we can easily communicate with international friends, understand clearly each others what they want or just simply know what are they trying to say. In study, it is better that using common language and every single one will understand what is the lecturer trying to teach. For example, if each one of the students in the class uses different language to communicate, definitely no one can understand each others and from that make a misunderstanding. Therefore, using common language is so important. Secondly, students can just study one or a few simple languages, but not so much, that can help students put down the pressure level in their studies journey.",
        "However, for the country, if the language of that country dies out, it is so dangerous as in politics, that country will be attacked easier. For instance, in politics, if they are using a same language, the opponents will also understand what are they planning and the opponents will avoid it. Therefore, they will win the battle. It is the biggest problem of being used just one language, but not a native language. Language is being made from the culture of a country and also by passing many thousand years, if the country dies out their language is also considered as being loss the country.",
        "In conclusions, to a certain extend I agree that the fewer language is, the lesser pressure that students have as they do not need to study so much. It's undeniable that people over the world would understand each other with a better version."
