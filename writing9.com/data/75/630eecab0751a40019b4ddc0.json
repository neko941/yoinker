        "I am writing this letter in response to your complaints I have received last week about the noises in my flat every afternoon. First of all, I would like to apologize for the inconvenience I had caused everyone as it was not my intention at all. My nephew stayed here last week because her mother has a work trip to another country. He brought a drum set as he stayed here to practice since he will have a music presentation this week. I didn't know that the noise he is making is so loud that it causes annoyance to the neighbours for I have worked all day.",
        "As my sister's work requires her to keep travelling to different places, there are times that my nephew will stay at my flat and will bring his instruments along with him. To ensure that it won't happen again, I will explain things to him that he should keep the noises down to avoid disturbing anyone. I will also buy a noise reduction wallpaper to make sure that it won't cause disturbances to my neighbours.",
        "I hope for your forgiveness for what happened.",
