        "Physical activities are crucial to people\u2019s health. Limited activities can lead to numerous health problems such as obesity, cardiovascular problems and hipper tension. Especially, long working hours in the offices, and spending time on TV and social media are important reasons for the adult movement. Although some believe people can be motivated to do training through arranged sporting organizations like Olympic Games and world cup, different ways can be more effective on it.",
        "People had been forced to consume an important range of the day in the job field. Therefore, they have limited time to make training. Moreover, matures spend a crucial part of the day on TV or social media. Banned physical actions cause  plenty of health problems. For instance, adults have long working hours and they are limited to moving. Additionally, they spend their time on TV outside of working hours. Long time watching TV and using the internet lead to the consumption of unhealthy food like fast foods and junk foods. Absolutely, unhealthy diets damage the health of adults.",
        "The general consideration of society is that organised sporting tournaments like the Olympic games can encourage people to do more physical movements.However, there are numerous ways to incent people to do more training, but it has little impact on people. I strongly believe education and other incentive programs are able to encourage people more than tournaments. To illustrate, education illustrates society's benefit from  sportive activities and the damages of  inactivity. Further, incentives  made by authorities and other social associations impact an adult to do more exercise.",
        "Exercises are important to save the balance of the body and stay healthy. Only devising games across the world cannot be enough to encourage people to do training. Education programs and other incentive programs have special effects on people's consideration of doing exercises."
