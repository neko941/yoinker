        "It is indeed that existence of some languages is gradually disappearing as they are spoken by a small proportion of society. It is always suggested by many, that to protect such languages government should take initiative and offer some financial aid. However, some portion of the population opposes it and considers it a sheer wastage of money. I will highlight both views in this essay following y my opinion which will incline towards the former.",
        "On the one hand, any language reflects the history, culture and traditional values of a nation and by the extinction of that ,language such values will be diminished which is a failure of that country. To preserve these  values, the government must spread awareness to save the language among the public and for ,this a good proportion of funds must be allocated. With this help from the government, various sessions and classes for free learning of language can be conducted and the young generation can be connected to their roots. Moreover, the funds should be allocated to creating movies, songs and books in that language so that through entertainment existence of the language can be preserved. For example, overall super hit movies are generally in English and the young generation is attracted to them. Hence, they are neglecting their own regional languages. In this way, if more content will be published in the regional languages then the audience will take an interest and the language learning process will start automatically.",
        "On the other hand, some people believe that instead of preserving old languages, money should be spent on Education, health and public services as they are basic needs of every human being. Also, such people believe in learning new international languages as they give a wide scope of learning such as famous articles, and books are published in them. The international books and movies provide more information. Hence, learning the mother tongue is a sheer waste of time and money.",
        "To sum up, it is true that education, health and public services must be the priorities but the extinction of a language means the death of all history, culture and traditions for which the freedom fighters have sacrificed their lives."
