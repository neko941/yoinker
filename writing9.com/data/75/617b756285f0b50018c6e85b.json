        "History plays a great role in terms of enhancing knowledge. In some countries,an increasing number of residents has become curious to know about the history of their homes.Below,the reasons behind this development will be discussed along with some ways through which citizens can research this.",
        "To begin with,there are quite a few reasons for which people feel the necessity to know about the past story of their homes.First of all,humans have the tendency to feel curious about their surroundings and the prime reasoning behind this development might be their nature of feeling curious.To illustrate,when people move into a new house and the house is a century old,they become excited to know about what happened in the past.After learning about the history they share this information with their friends and family,thus it becomes a topic to gossip about for them .Another reason is sometimes people want to sense a connection to their living areas and therefore,they feel interested in this development.For example,in cities,houses and buildings are all quite similar and residents do not feel connected to their homes. That is to say, through this development they try to find a connection so that they feel fulfilled.",
        "In this advanced era,it is quite easy to find out the past stories.For instance, the Internet is a great resource to learn about anything,whether it's the history of the place or about what people assume about that place. Citizens can simply search on the internet and from there they can find tremendous information.Another way to find out is asking in the neighbourhood,the residents who have been living in that area or building for a long time can give so much information about its history.",
        "To sum up,people have found it exciting to learn history,therefore,residents nowadays are more likely to research and technology have made it easier for them to conduct their research."
