        "It is acknowledged that, nowadays, various kinds of unethical television programs, violent cartons and games broadcast on television and the Internet. Also, children indulge themselves in these types of activities. Although, there are unreliable content, illegal information and violent shows yet, kids feel entertained. Hence, exposure to such kind of media has severe impacts on overall development of youngsters. This essay will not only discuss the harmful effects of unnecessary exposure, but also suggest some ideas to ameliorate the situation.",
        "To begin with, there are various opposite effects of unethical TV shows on the upbringing of kids. Firstly, violent video games play a pivotal role in creating a negative mentality.

Secondly, in today\u2019s scenario unethical content available online because of that, offspring can put themselves in sexual activities and also, can drug addictive.",
        "However, appropriate measures need to be taken to tackle this problem. Initially, that is to say, government should place restriction on the media industry as well as penalize who play this kind of content. For instance, in U.S government prohibits the broadcast of violent media on T.V it crate positive impacts on child development.In addition to this, parents also should pay attention towards their children how\u2019s their kids are using the technology.",
        "In conclusion, while there are numerous negative effects of unethical media on the growth of youngsters, I think even with the help of government and parents we can improve this situation."
