        "People have different views about the effectiveness of the traditional written test. While there are several modules that should not be accessed by this formal exam, I still believe that it should not be replaced completely.",
        "The traditional written test is a very common way to access the educational achievements due to its convenience. Firstly, it can be conducted in a short time to examine a large number of students. Secondly, it has many types of questions to test different kinds of knowledge and skills in students, namely multiple choice, short answers, reports, thesis or long essays. That is also a reason why the written test can be used for both theoretical and practical modules. Finally, as long as the written examination still exists, the handwriting, which is the skill that is necessary for all time, will never be lost in the technology world.",
        "On the other hand, the formal \u201cpaper and pen\u201d test is not the best way to examine student\u2019s skills in some courses. For example, in language courses, speaking is the skills that need to be accessed orally. A student can write a good essay in new language does not mean that he/she can speak it fluently. Similarly, for some mini-research projects that are related to business, social science and art, beside a written final report, a presentation will be the most suitable test for teachers to check not only their students\u2019 knowledge, but also other soft-skills like public speaking, organizing, presenting and even teamwork. Furthermore, examiners can access the student\u2019s abilities by different tailored practical coursework. This is by far the most suitable method to know whether the students are able to understand and transfer their knowledge to practice.",
        "To conclude, the type of examinations should be depended on the nature of the educational programs\u2019 curriculum. However, I still think that the written test is the most common and effective method for all educational organizations."
