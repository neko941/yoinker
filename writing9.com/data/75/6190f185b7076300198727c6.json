        "It is true that many nations allow parents the possibility to decide if their children will attend single-sex or co-education . Some people argue that single-sex learning can lead to several obvious harmful consequences in the long run . In my opinion , I completely agree with this view and believe that the best choice for children is going to mixed-gender schools .",
        "On the one hand , studying at single-sex schools can help pupils to increase their academic performances and decrease the social distractions in the classroom . When boys and girls are separated , the gender attraction between students will be avoided and then no romance stories occurred in the classroom . As a result , pupils become more concentrated and do better at their studies and then they achieve good grades at the end of the year . Moreover , the level of distraction at single-sex education become  lower compared to  co-education. Consequently , the scholars waste less of their time which should be invested in meaningful activities and then they will have a better environment for studies .",
        "On the other hand , it is often argued that sending children to single-gender schools is not a realistic choice in the long run . Firstly, learning in a mixed-gender environment can reduce sexism and improve  gender equality .In other words , boys will learn to appreciate and respect girls and then they avoid the misogyny problems in the future . Also , this way of learning will prepare them for  real-life and build an equal society . Secondly , co-education favorise the interaction between the two genders and then they will become more extroverted and audacious which are very important qualities for them when they would build a family and choose their partners .",
        "In conclusion , despite that single-sex education can bring some useful advantages to pupils , I believe that it is not a good choice for them because this way of learning will not help them to in their professional and personal lives ."
