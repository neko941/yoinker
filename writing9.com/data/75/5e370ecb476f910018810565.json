        "The business market has grown like never before comprising of manufacturers, suppliers and vendors in huge masses. In such a scenario, some people believe that in today's tough competition, the organizations must have distinctive products for establishing their mark. This essay completely disagrees with the statement and explains why selling unique items is not the only way to be successful and suggests two ways of running organisations with good profits.",
        "To survive in a competitive market, it is required that the demand of the product is taken into consideration. To elaborate, if any item is mostly consumed by the general public over and over, it will naturally increase demand of a product. Eatables, for instance, are highly consumed, therefore, the business related to food can run profits, even if it is not different from what others are selling. Clearly, it shows that demand can also be a factor for organizations to run successfully.",
        "Another contributor to sustain in a competition is by maintaining the quality standards.If a company sells high quality items, consumers will undoubtedly return back due to product satisfaction. Amul organization, for example, is known for the best milk diary, hence, this business has managed to take off with huge gains and maintain since past 30 years.  This proves that the quality supersedes uniqueness.",
        "To sum up, Eventough creative and unique goods are welcomed in a market, it is not the only way to succeed. Addressing the people's needs and managing standards are also ways to keep the companies growing."
