        "Many people believe that making some risky decisions is significant for individuals in both their professional and private lives. From my point of view, although taking risks could have some drawbacks, I think the advantages of taking risks outweigh its disadvantages.",
        "Making some risky decisions could cause some terrible outcomes. Individuals may face a trade-off between undertaking this high level of risk and receiving a high-level payoff when making risky decisions, and it is possible that people may not only achieve the desired outcome but may lose some important things in their professional or in their daily lives. For example, employees may feel unsatisfied with their current work and they are willing to shift to another company, which behaviour is considered to be risky. However, they may become unemployed if they quit their current jobs immediately as they find it difficult for them to find new jobs, and they may have no salary to maintain their daily lives.",
        "However, taking risks in both professional and daily lives could also be beneficial for people, as taking risks could be helpful to find more opportunities. many people face fierce competition and they need to work hard to maintain their living standards. As a result, taking risks is considered to be of vital importance, as it may bring rich material or spiritual rewards when achieving success. For example, people may earn a huge amount of money by investing in the correct stocks, or they can achieve a higher salary or a manager position by shifting to other companies. Both these two behaviours are risky, while making these risky decisions could contribute to a better situation.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that the advantages of taking risks outweigh its disadvantages, and individuals could achieve a more successful life by making some risky decisions."
