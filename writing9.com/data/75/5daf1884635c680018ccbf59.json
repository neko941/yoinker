        "In this present age, number of medical research increasing significantly day by day.Some people believe that, utilizing animals in medical studies is good for human beings, whereas others argue against it and state that, employing animals in medical laboratory is cruel.In my point of view I support the former argument.In this essay we will scrutinize both views and analyse the importance of animal usage in the medical laboratory.",
        "Do you think using animals in laboratory is a bad practice, certainly not, because in the present era, the number of new diseases rising significantly ever second. For instance, according to the latest statistics released by BBC reveals the atrocious fact that, 300 new diseases were reported in the last two years in different Asian countries.In order to tackle this problem we need new drugs to cure these illnesses.If we want to produce new drugs, we have to analyse  the result of new medicine. Certainly, we cannot able to experiment the product on the  human body, so we are choosing animals for this purpose.",
        "Some people believe that, employing animals in medical exercise is cruel.Furthermore, they argue that animals also have an equal right to live in this planet.Moreover, they think that, instead of using animals for research, we can use machines for this purpose. Unfortunately, if we consider the accuracy and cost, we can understand that, we cannot replace animals with technology.Because our technology did not attain that level of accuracy yet.For example, a recent attempt conducted in India used deep mining technology to find new medicine for cancer, they spent almost 1 million for this attempt, but they only got 40% of accuracy in the result.",
        "In conclusion, if we consider the necessity of new medicines,  we can easily understand the importance of   animal experimentation in medical studies, .Furthermore, we cannot experiment new things on the human body. So the animal experiment is vital in the  medical analysis."
