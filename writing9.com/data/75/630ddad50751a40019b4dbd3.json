        "Recently, extreme violence in movies and dramas is contributing to a growing number of social issues. This leads teenagers to copy the violent actions in the movies without noticing what is wrong. To deal with this problem, teachers and parents should be responsible for teaching them what is acceptable and what is not in the real world.",
        "To begin with, teenagers always look up to celebrities in the movie and they dream of themselves being just like key roles in the movie. For this reason, they are likely to follow their role models in the movie recklessly without noticing what they are exactly doing. If they have a chance to watch movies related to severe crime, they can easily imitate the convicts because they are too young to consider how their actions might cause severe problems. For example, a famous film \u201cSunny\u201d was released in 2009 in Korea. The film was an incredible hit among teenagers, and copying key roles\u2019 fashions and gestures was a trend in the number of teenagers. However, there was a scene in the film where some kids have drugs and do violent behaviors. And the teenagers who were motivated by the film also did the same things and attacked their classmates.",
        "To prevent this severe problem, parents and teachers should teach children to recognize the difference between reality and fiction. Since children recognize situations in the movie as real, they have little ability to distinguish what is accepted in the real world. Therefore, adults (parents and teachers) are responsible for teaching teenagers which actions are not appropriate to follow and which are possible. By teaching them, teenagers will be mature enough not to follow any reckless behaviors in the films. For example, since 2012, elementary schools in Seoul have shown children a documentary about the victims attacked by teenagers who were imitating violent activities in the film. Through this program, children could learn not to copy any harmful activities in the movies. As a result, teenagers\u2019 copycat crimes have been reduced by 30%.",
        "In conclusion, as the level of violence goes up in films, teenagers are more likely to do copycat crimes. To cope with this problem, teachers and parents should be in charge of teaching them what is appropriate in the real world."
