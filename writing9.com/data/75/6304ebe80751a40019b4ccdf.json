        "In this modern era, there is a great surge in the present technology. People are using this development to travel around the world and use social media for communication purposes around the world. In this essay, I will discuss both advantages and disadvantages and then we will see whether the advantages overweigh the disadvantages or not.",
        "On the one side, There is a great change in transportation facilities to travel around the world. Basically, in earlier days, people used to travel from one place to another place using bicycles, boats, by walk, etc. But, nowadays, people are travelling by Aeroplanes, subway lines, etc to reach other countries. Using this transportation people will reach their destination fastly but there is also a spread of diseases. For example, In 2019, people around the world suffered from Coronavirus which is spread fastly due to transportation.",
        "On the other side, there are many advantages to travelling and social media. By travelling country's economy will be developed due to tourism.
