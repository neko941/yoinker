        "A huge part of the leisure time of today's public is spent on their smartphones . In my side of view, this is a negative development. One important factor in this situation is  the attraction of digital devices and their ability to entertain  people . Smartphones have provided us with enormous numbers of things to do and that is why  humans prefer them over any other habit .",
        "Meanwhile , the convenience which smartphones have offered us is undoubted. For example ,  people can sit on their chairs while , they can text message , call  one another and play games . So they do not have to bother themselves and  go visit their friends or go to some place to play games .",
        "Having said that , this situation is more negative than What most populations think . Although , some crowd think it is a positive action because  phones brought us this opportunity to work on our communication skills while  We are resting at home . They say that, For example , by playing online games on mobile devices not only we can be entertained. also , we can improve only our English or any other language speaking because we are now capable of talking to a native person .",
        "I strongly believe that this is a negative side of technology . There is a major downside to this , for example , with 8 hours of working and 8 hours of sleeping there is no more free time for us to care about our health and body  if we spend  most of the last 8 hours of the day on tech devices So the lack of enough physical activity is one downside of this over usage. Moreover ,  smartphones and their social media applications Can also be harmful to mental health . For instance, the unlimited usage of mobile devices is very destructive to the Social behaviour of teenagers . A teenager would never make real friends on smartphones and she is represented by numerous lies  when she compares herself with those lies , she would likely  be disappointed with her life, Instagram Application is full of pictures of having wealth and fun while the normal life is not just about those.",
        "In conclusion , many people around the world are using their free time on their cellphones due to their huge attraction of them and  the fact that they are more convenient to use . however , they could be used as educational devices as their positive aspect , the negative aspects of those are more destructive like mental disappointment and lack of physical activity."
