        "It is often argued that what the element makes someone happy in life? The first thing that comes one mind is an ample amount of money. In this essay, I will discuss why money comes as a first choice while people talking about happiness and what could be the other elements that also need to be happy.",
        "First of all, money gives people a supreme power called purchasing power. In other words, money can use to own any luxury items that one can desire. There is no other alternative to such an option, and it is proven in every country and society. For example, if any latest model high-end cars, modern luxury apartments, a luxury foreign trip is in someone\u2019s wish list, only plenty of money can help him or her. For that reason, a certain group of people considered money as a primary item of happiness.",
        "On the other hand, there are a lot of examples available that with plenty of wealth some peoples are tremendously unhappy with their life. While research has shown what else could be the reasons that make them unhappy, the first element that comes in front is sound healthiest. Sound health can give immeasurable benefit to someone\u2019s life. Besides, the second most essential thing is a trustworthy family bonding, which is derived from a peaceful mental state. People are facing severe trouble in life without good family bonding and feels isolated, however they are rich enough.",
        "To conclude, I think money is not the only thing that is required to be happy. A combination of money, sound health, and perfect relationship can make one\u2019s life happy and can give a sense of fulfilment."
