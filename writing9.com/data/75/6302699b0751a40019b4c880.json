        "There are conflicting views regarding the necessity of having the education to live a successful life. Some advocate that one needs education qualifications to be successful, whereas others believe that they do not certainly result in the person's achievements. This essay is going to discuss these two views and will come to a conclusion.",
        "On one hand, most occupations have become specialized, and performing them requires educated people. For example, being a physician, engineer, teacher, etc. requires specialized education. No one can do them without academically learning them. Furthermore, educated people can think systematically and solve their problems through the problem-solving method they have learned in the university/at school. They have good knowledge of scientific theories and read books, using the experiences of others, i.e., the writer.",
        "On the other hand, the proponents of the second view argue that one can succeed without being educated. They claim that many well-educated graduates cannot achieve what they are supposed to, so they fail in their careers. In fact, they declare that one needs other qualifications and skills, such as perseverance, desire, interest, financial resources, good communication skills, and so on. For instance, if somebody wants to be a good hairdresser, she should not be obliged to go to university. Besides being able to have expertise in her job, she needs to get along with others well and have the required talent, perseverance, and financial resources.",
        "To sum up the dispute, I believe that the definition of success is different for different people. Nevertheless, everybody needs some kind of education suitable for her own life and career. Not all people have to go to university; they can attend some courses which give them insight and help them find an appropriate job."
