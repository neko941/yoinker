        "I hope you are doing well. I am writing this letter to express my sympathies for the huge loss of your pet dog Scooby.",
        "Honestly, I moved to tears when I received your letter regarding the demise of Sooby. I still remember that day when both take this at your home as a small baby of just 5 days old. He was such a loving, caring and friendly dog. Moreover, I believe you and your family\u2019s attachment and care towards Scooby were much more than the normal people have with their pets. I pray to god that he has a good place in heaven with good memories of all.",
        "Truly, I am short of words to console you for this loss. I know it is very hard to recover from such kind of happenings but this is also true that life has to move on further. Thus, I request you to take care of yourself and your family\u2019s health in this hard time. Please let me know if any kind of help I can offer in this unfortunate time.",
        "I hope my words would help to relieve your pain and I am planning to visit you very soon.",
