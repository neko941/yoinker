        "It is true that printed newspapers and books would become less popular in the future, since they are not accessible as well as online ones, which do not need to be paid for. I generally disagree with this argument as I believe that printed books and magazines will never be disappeared.",
        "These days, thanks to technology we have an access to almost all books and news on apps and websites, which enable people to read whatever they desire. Although most books could be found online, all of them might not be free to the public. For example, citizens have to pay to be able to read online books. And also due to copy-right rules, some authors may not allow their books to be published on online apps or websites. Hence, the public would have to buy printed newspapers and books from markets.",
        "Despite being available all books online and free, there are always some individuals who are interested in reading ones. They relish the experience of going to book shops, searching for their interesting books ,and after being bought, having their favourite books on their shelves. For instance, publishers have to pay attention to these kinds of buyers, and in spite of selling online, they would keep their marketing in book stores. Furthermore, we always must consider blind people, who need to purchase their special printed books or newspapers, and we can never deprive them of the joy of reading.",
        "In conclusion, it is so likely for books and magazines to be less popular in printed form in future, but because of the main importance they have amongst the public, I disagree with this state."
