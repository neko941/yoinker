        "Art expresses the thoughts of human mind. It can be related to the beauty of nature, culture and traditions and situations of society.  The creativity of art doesn't give only feeling of joy and happiness, but also learn some good lesson to make aware the people about their surroundings. People argue that complete freedom should be given to artists so that they can develop their ideas properly.  I agree with this statement and I will discuss my viewpoints in subsequent paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, an artist can generate many beautiful thoughts with free of mind and entertain the people. Artists are those who can give a proper knowledge to youngsters. They can make the variety of art related to culture, which is followed by teenagers. Therefore,  they can help them to understand their past. Besides that, these creators are the role model of the youngsters, thereby when they do any project which is helpful to society and give a new direction to it, then teenagers also follow them and give their contribution for the goodwill of the community. For instance, Salman Khan is a great artist of Indian film industry. He makes his movies on various topics to learn about the humanity.",
        "Furthermore,  they can also spread the awareness of surroundings to the people. They can highlight the social issues such as inequality, caste system and poverty. It helps the public to give feedback to government. If there is any violence condition in the society, then artists can raise awareness about this through their art. Moreover, they can make a masterpiece of art, if there is no fear for them and have a total freedom.  This masterwork can attract the people from other countries also. As a result, they can also help the government to develop the economy of the nation.",
        "It can be concluded that, the social contributions to society by artists can be done only if they have the freedom to create thoughts and ideas on each and every content."
