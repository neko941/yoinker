        "It is believed by some that video games can exert educational value, availing gamers to access knowledge while enjoying games, whereas  opponents contend that a number of detrimental effects can arise from playing such games. From my perspective, I believe a few advantages can be seen in the process of game playing, however, the benefits cannot outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "On the one hand, playing video games can surely assist people in learning, especially for those who do not acclimate to ordinary educational methods. For example, an increasing number of therapists and parents now adopt the method of learning through playing for children who suffered from ADHD, it has been proved to be an applicable and effective approach to ameliorate children\u2019s learning condition. Additionally, several skills, such as concentration, problem solving and communication can be acquired via the process of playing games. These features have proved that digital games can have certain effects on learning  while being a useful tool.",
        "On the other hand, I argue that several disadvantages can outweigh the benefits as some might become obsessive with those games. With such addiction, in certain aspects, it might lead to insufficient sleeping and even decreasing attention span which can further exacerbate students in their learning conditions. Moreover, it is undeniable that over-using digital devices can pose negative effects on the eyes, resulting in nearsightedness and other optical diseases. Many youngsters nowadays have suffered from these problems known as civilized illness. Students in Taiwan, for example, have the number almost 80 per cent of the population wear glasses, this evidence indicates that playing video games can have severe implications for gamers.",
        "In conclusion, though a number of benefits can be seen in playing games, some obvious drawbacks can still outnumber the advantages."
