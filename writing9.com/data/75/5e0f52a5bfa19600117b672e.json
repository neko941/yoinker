        "Although, a lot of people believe, moving to an English speaking country is the eminent way in learning the language, but still, it is not the only way in learning it. I strongly agree with the statement and in my perspective, moving might be helpful, however, there are various other ways using which one can master English staying at his home.",
        "The key feature in mastering any language is constant practice and learning from his/her own mistakes, hence making studying English in USA or Great Britain an excellent choice. Since living  there allows them to communicate with the native English speakers on a regular basis, who speak the language with superlative diction and grammar, making it easier for them to practice and correct themselves. For example, a person living in London has to speak in English whenever they are supposed to talk to anyone which helps them in improving their language. In contrast, a person living in a foreign nation is not exposed to English proper enough on a regular basis which makes it difficult to learn.",
        "",
        "The advancement in teaching modality in the past few decades has completely changed the means of education and made learning English an easy task for many students throughout the world. While, there are some difficulties and limitations, it is still possible to learn English living in any foreign country. There are a lot of schools, colleges and universities teaching English in many parts of the world helping students in learning it. Not only the institutes, in the present day there are a lot of  softwares available for improving vocabulary, grammar and to even  practice with native English speakers through video calling, making it possible for people in getting command over the language staying in their own country. For example, online English classes available on social platforms like YouTube and other websites are becoming very popular these days and the number of people utilizing these videos is increasing in millions day by day throughout the world.",
        "In conclusion, I personally believe, though, studying English in an English speaking nation can be very useful, but it is not the only viable option. Mastering English living in  a foreign nation is not impossible, all it requires is a substantial and meticulous use of the available resources."
