        "The living on Earth will have more problems for future generation and people must spend money on developing space technology. In my opinion, I agree that future human population should start to spend money for opportunity living on Mars.",
        "First of all, living on Earth has become harder every year because of carbon emissions. This means that many manufactures throw carbon into the air. For example, every year in Antarctica scientists fixed many anomalies snowing melt and grew level water in the sea that is why the land of the planet is flooded. Without carbon emission by manufactures, our planet can be saved by people. Thus, many people start to move to another area where water does not flood the land and in the future a great amount of people have to research the other planet for living there.",
        "Another point to consider that moving to another planet such as Mars can help in restoring our planet for the future generation. In other words, people can restore the environment such as forest, land, mountains and others. For instance, restoring our planet helps to stop changing global warming because many people who will live on Earth will be to consume in small amounts. Without restoring our environment, Earth can die in the near future. Therefore, researching new planet can help in saving our planet.",
        "In conclusion, despite people having a different opinion, I think people must research new planet for saving a number of people and it will help to restore our environment for the future generation."
