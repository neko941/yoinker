        "I`m writting to inform you about losing my luggage while I was travelling by train from Chelsea to Manchester on 14th May 2022 and I was travelling on the 10:30 am train.  Although I waited on the correct luggage point for almost 15 minutes, it never arrived.",
        "It is a quite large luggage and it was carrying items over 10kg. It is a blue coloured one and the handle, tyres and the zips are in white colour. It also had a huge black coloured key tag with the peace sign on it. You will also be able to find a tag with my name and my personal identification number on it. In addition, inside the bag you will be able to see a lot of chocolate packs and 20 reading books.",
        "Since it was heavy, station master asked me to handover the luggage to the storage unit. So I`m assuming it should be on the storage unit itself where helpers might have forgot to drop off my luggage at the Manchester station.",
        "It has over 5kg of chocolates which might get melted if we don`t take resolve the issue soon. I would appreciated it if you could look into this matter at your earliest convenience.",
