        "Teenagers are known as troublemakers in  society. Like many teenagers, I also have experienced rapid physical and emotional developments due to hormonal changes. These hormones make teens feel invincible and cause them to take higher risks and danger. Government regulations such as curfew are used during a time of war or in more recent times to control a pandemic. In my opinion, imposing a curfew to control teenagers is demeaning and counterproductive to the growth of the future generation.",
        "Humans, adults and teenagers alike have the right to live a free life. Imposing this type of regulation without a lawful reason is eliminate the freedom for teens to experience life. I have experienced curfew during pandemics. It was an unpleasant and stressful experience. Consequently, the life qualities such as helping each other, identifying threats, and individual confidence are diminished. I believe imposing a curfew on teenagers will create a future generation who are unable to react to complex life situations.",
        "In addition, the Teenage period is the best age to recognize themselves as independent human. Relying on adults makes them feel dependent. In fact, young people always find a way to gain their freedom and independence. This may lead to more opportunities for bad actors to influence or bring harm to these young adults. For instance, the unavailability of family members to accompany, them may lead them right into the hands of people with bad intentions. This establishes these regulations are ineffective.",
        "To conclude, it is impractical to impose a curfew during nighttime to limit teenagers\u2019 activities due to the above reasons. However, increasing the awareness, and education among teenagers regarding dangers is the better way to keep teenagers safe and maintain peace in society."
