        "Nowadays, the majority of people do not follow traffic regulations. Some people believe that the only way to develop road safety is to give stricter punishment to people who are breaking traffic laws. I strongly agree with this statement and, I think that also imposing huge fines and cancelling offenders' licence help to improve road safety problems and, I will explain my reason for it in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "There are many methods to improve road safety issues. First and foremost, give stronger punishment to offenders who break traffic regulations like cancelling their licence. In other words, if government cancel offenders' licence, as a result, offenders never do the same mistake again  which helps to improve the road safety problem very rapidly. Secondly, sending offenders to prison for a few duration creates fear in them and they will never try to break traffic regulations again. Also, police authorities should take strict action against every person for their crime. For example, Sikkim one of the states in India released strict laws against offenders  not riding bikes carrying Triple passengers otherwise people need to pay a huge fine and also  spent 5 years in prison.",
        "Furthermore, imposing fines on rule breakers helps to reduce this problem very efficiently and improve road safety problem. For example, the Indian government released rupees 10000 fines for individuals if they break driving laws and regulations. As a result, according to the past year's ,record it can be seen that the offence rate in driving is decreasing continuously.  Thus, giving striker punishment helps to develop road safety problems very efficient way.",
        "In conclusion, the road safety issue is a huge problem at the current time due to breaking traffic rules. However, in my opinion, giving stricker punishments like imposing huge fines and cancelling offenders' licences help to improve this issue."
