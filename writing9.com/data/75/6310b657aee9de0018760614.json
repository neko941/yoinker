        "There is a saying that schools need to be more entertaining, and others think that their only purpose is to educate. I partly agree that schools need to be more entertaining, and this essay will explain why.",
        "People used to think that students only need study at school. However, they ignore the educational effects of entertainment which comes from school. When students have entertainment in school, they are not only for fun but also learning a range of skills. For instance, the teacher will organise a game and assign students to a team, which is an efficient way to teach teamwork to students. Also, some recreational activities in schools can stimulate students' creativity. There are some schools in China; that will organise a create snowman activities in winter. When students attend this activity, they will use their brains to imagine what kind of snowman are they going to build. In this process, students reduce stress and improve their creativity.",
        "On the other hand, excessive entertainment in school can also cause problems. If there is too much entertainment in school; students would like to associate school with play. Namely, they will pay more attention on play instead of studying in school. Therefore, it will have some negative effects on their academic performance. Moreover, many students get together to play games, which may lead to danger. Because it is difficult to manage a great number of students, and sometimes it will cause stampede accidents.",
        "To sum up, I partly agree that schools need to do more entertaining. Despite excessive entertainment having some disadvantages, schools can implement some regulations and protective measures, and limit the time of entertainment."
