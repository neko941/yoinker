        "Food is one of the most crucial needs of a human being. Some people choose to go out and eat in a restaurant, in contrast, others would prefer to prepare and consume their food at their home. Personally, I prefer homemade recipes for the fact that they are healthier, more delicious and less expensive than those eaten in restaurants.",
        "Homemade food is far healthier than ready food for many reasons. First, while cooking at home, who wants to cook for the family members, chooses all the ingredients with a lot of care, they must be fresh and of good quality. Besides, the ingredients and the utensils used are clean. In contrast, in most restaurants, and because of the big quantity of prepared food, they cannot take care of all the materials and the utensils to be always cleaned. And, for example, in restaurants, the oil used in the fryers is used many times so that it becomes  unhealthy and sometimes toxic, while at home, the oil is changed frequently. All these differences affect the food taste and consequently, homemade food is more delicious.",
        "Besides this, cooking at home is less expensive than buying ready-made food or eating in restaurants. For the same price, a bigger quantity of food is prepared at home. Especially for big families, they can prepare food for all family members at the cost of only half the quantity in the restaurant. In restaurants, you have to pay not only the price of food but also the cost of sitting in the place and the service you are receiving. That is why you must pay much more in the restaurant than in your home in order to eat the same plate. As a result, it is unaffordable to always eat in restaurants.",
        "In conclusion, in spite of the desire of eating in restaurants on some occasions, such as birthdays, I usually prefer homemade food for the fact that it is healthier and more affordable. I advise everyone to try cooking at home. It is a great pleasure for me."
