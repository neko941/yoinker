        "Language barrier is always assumed as the biggest challenge which results in a variety of social problems as well as practical ones for immigrants when they live in an adopted country. From my point of view, this is absolutely true because of the reasons below.",
        "Firstly, the migrants who run into troubles with communicating are usually the victims of racism. When people come to a strange place without acquiring sufficient verbal skills, they could not understand as well as observing the native culture. As a result, these could not be in harmony with the local residents and it comes as no shock that these will experience some discrimination. Moreover, these immigrants are prone to penalties due to the fact that they are unable to perceive the distinct regulations with their home country\u2019s ones. For example, wearing a poppy-printed T-shirt in Vietnam is a normal thing, nonetheless, it is considered guilty in some countries such as Poland and Germany.",
        "In terms of daily life, language barrier also triggers some serious complications. It is noticeable that if having difficulties in communicating with foreigners, the newcomers could not express or share their feelings and when holding the emotions for a long time, these people might suffer severe depression. Besides, failing to use the native language is likely to deprive the migrants of seizing job chances because companies will never accept the applicants who are unable to communicate with partners in the office. Accordingly, these people are going to get financial troubles and it is predictable that the local crime rate will increase since these might do illegal things to subsist.",
        "Subsequently weighing all the aforementioned, I reach a conclusion that language barrier is the source of many problems with which people might confront when they settle in a new country."
