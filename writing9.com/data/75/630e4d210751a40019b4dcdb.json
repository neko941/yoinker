As you know this equipment is a crucial part of the computer thus it is challenging for me to survive without a keyboard, as a result, I am unable to complete my task within the working time period.",
        "I know you are a reputed firm of our city, therefore, I would like to recommend that please change this part as soon as possible so that I can continue my work with a delay of time. I will send it to you by tomorrow morning.",
