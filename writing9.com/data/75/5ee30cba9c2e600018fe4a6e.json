        "In the United Kingdom, When people arrive at retirement age, They prefer to live at old age home with other similar age of people.However, a debate ongoing on who should pay the expenses of them. From my point of view it's both the Authorities and family responsibility to pay for services.",
        "To begin with, When people became elderly the young once feel as they are burden on the family. As a result, they migrate them to old age homes. Moreover, Aged people are suffering from many health related problems, Such as a diabetes, Heart problems and so on. Thus, it's their family's duty to pay the expenses of their treatment. As, they are not moved there by themselves. For example, my friend's Grand mother suffering from cancer, Also she lives in one of the old health centre in my city. My friend sends money to cover her expenses as the treatment is so expensive.",
        "On the other hand, People give their valuable vote to nominate the government, So it's  their priority to help them during their old age. However, some people think that instead of spending money behind aged people, The authorities spend money to develop a better health system, education system and develop the infrastructure of the city. For instance, The Canadian government spending the largest portion of money to provide better health care to older people of the country. Thus, Canadian country is known as providing better quality of life for their citizens.",
        "To sum up, elderly people are an important part of society.Moreover, they contribute their whole life to serve the country and their family, As a result, Now it's time to pay back them by providing better healthcare and the love."
