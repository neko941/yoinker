        "Dear Sara,",
        "I hope you are doing well. I am extremely excited that you are planning to go camping and I would be more than happy to give you some suggestions.",
        "First of all, camping is a great activity to unwind from our daily routine. As I know that you are always interested in these kinds of activities so you will enjoy outdoor residing. Plus, you would not only participate in several ventures such as barbecues, cooking food outside the tent, and bushwalking, but it also provides a chance to learn new things about nature.",
        "Despite its fun side, there could be some possible demerits also. As you are a private person, you may find it difficult to share a bathroom with other individuals even a tent. what's more, you'd have to deal with insects as well as bug bites so that's why I would suggest you wear a full sleeve t-shirt.",
        "By the way, I really want to join this trip but unfortunately, I will have to attend several meetings next week. I will go with you next time,  I hope you will enjoy your journey.",
        "Best of luck with your camping experience.",
