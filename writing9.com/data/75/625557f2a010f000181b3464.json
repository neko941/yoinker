        "The trend of immigrating and settling in an entirely different country is increasing nowadays. However, the majority of the population still spends their whole life in their native place or close to it. Reasons for this attitude among the people and its pros and cons will be discussed further in this essay.",
        "Firstly, being in a familiar place creates a sense of safety and security. Since people and places are known to them, they get to live in a comfort zone from which they do not want to move out. Secondly, one gets to enjoy the advantage of living near parents and friends. This can help in all the phases of life. For example, whether it is finding the first job or buying a house, it is far easier when one has enough connections. These are the reasons that keep people in their own country, state or city.",
        "Although living in or close to the native place has many perks, there are some disadvantages to it. People living in a familiar environment do not get real-time exposure to the world. This can limit their growth. Also, oftentimes, there are very few job opportunities in these places. This is especially true for those living in villages. If these people decide to live in that village for their whole life, they will most probably have to choose farming as their means of livelihood. This may not suit educated young people who have greater aspirations in life. Thus, obviously, staying in one\u2019s native place can hurt one\u2019s personal and professional growth. On the other hand, being in a strange and different place challenges one emotionally as well as financially and ultimately helps the individual to grow independently.",
        "To conclude, the home environment safeguards the individual and makes their lives less stressful. However, starting from scratch and managing things independently in a distinct place is difficult in the beginning but rewarding in the end."
