        "Travelling is a part of the basic routine in everyone's life. There has long been a subject of discussion that individuals should use bikes instead of any other motor vehicle to travel from one place to another even in this technological world. My view coincides with the given proposition for a number of reasons which I will discuss in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "There is a myriad of arguments in favour of my stance. The most telling one lies in the fact that commuting through a bicycle could help to save the environment. Not only can use of a cycle helps to keep surroundings pollution-free, but it might also play a key role to reduce traffic congestion in the cities. For example, a recent analysis has shown that the places where individuals prefer to use bikes for short distances are less polluted and congested as compared to the other ones. As a result, the people who live at such localities have fewer chances to suffer from respiratory problems and can travel without any problem of getting stuck in the traffic.",
        "Another fact to note is that the preference of using a bicycle than a motor car should not be deemed to be as a wastage of time, but an exercise. This is because the more one will use a bicycle to commute from one place to another, the more he will be healthy, not only physically but mentally as well. Thus, he can keep his body fit and fiddle and also can increase concentration power. For instance, people who do cycling on a daily basis tend to have  stronger knees and arms than who had not cycled from ages.",
        "To summarize, use of cycles to cover short distances have its own advantages as it helps to keep the environment clean and proves to be a healthy exercise for the human body. Therefore, it appears to me that it is a better way to commute using bicycle than motor vehicles."
