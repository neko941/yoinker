        "In the modern era, a number of individuals opt to become entrepreneurs instead of working for other organisations or companies. This essay shall delve into the causes of the  growing trend and discuss some possible demerits of running own business.",
        "There are a myriad of reasons why people choose self-employment over a job. The most preponderant one is that the increasing work pressure by organisations and fewer salaries not only takes a toll on the health of employees but also takes away their family time. For instance, most multinational companies expect the individuals working in their organisations to devote a minimum of nine hours in the office and give targets to them as well. Servicemen are seldom given financial perks for their extra efforts. However, entrepreneurship provides a better chance to individuals to balance their professional as well as personal life. It also gives them hope that more efforts would lead to more profit.",
        "On the others hand, becoming self-employed brings some disadvantages along with it. The biggest con is that business involves huge risks. One might have to suffer huge losses in case the business fails. Such a financial crisis may also lead to suicidal thoughts among businessmen. Ashok Singh, for example, the founder of Cafe coffee day attempted suicide a few years ago because he was not able to cope up with the consecutive losses faced by his cafe. Therefore, before setting up a venture,  one has to keep the risk factor in mind and become strong enough to tackle failure.",
        "In conclusion, it can be said that setting up own business is a better choice because of reasons such as less work pressure and more profits. But, the risk factor in trade is not really easy to handle."
