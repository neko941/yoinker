        "With an enormous rise in the world population, demand for resources such as oil and gas has also increased tremendously. Some people are coming up with a thought of excavation of the undiscovered resource areas around the globe for meeting up the increased demand. I strongly disagree with this notion because of the environmental risk it possesses and considering the various sustainable energy resources available.",
        "The main reason why discovering of new areas of resourced should be discouraged is the detrimental effects these resourced have on our environment. Combustion of fossil fuels emits harmful gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide that are the major causes of global warming. Moreover, drilling the earth\u2019s surface for locating oil and gas can significantly damage the underground stability and can also cause drying of underground water causing desertification. In fact, the discovery of such resources also leads to loss of human lives. For example, China, which produces more than one-third of annual global coal products, accounts for more than two-thirds of mining deaths around the world each year.",
        "Furthermore, considering the renewable sources of energy has become important nowadays. The alternative sources of energy like, solar energy, tidal energy and wind energy are not only in abundance, but also pose no harmful effects on our environment. Now it is high time to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and resort to using greener sources of energy. These energy sources are cleaner and sustainable, and can be used in any area. For instance, India\u2019s Cochin airport has become the first airport in the world to function completely on solar energy.",
        "To conclude, excavation of unexplored areas to meet the increased demand of energy should be discouraged because of their limited availability and harmful effects on the environment. Therefore, it is vital to harness renewable energy sources, available in abundance, to meet our demands and it can considerably reduce the damage to our environment."
