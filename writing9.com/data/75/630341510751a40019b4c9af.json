        "Transformation in daily life is the key to coping with any adverse situation in future and making our life easier. Some people think that people should keep carrying out the same activities that they have been doing for a long time. I believe that implementation is the necessary process in our life to enhance our life. In this essay, I am going to support my view with appropriate arguments and relevant examples.",
        "First of all, making some changes in our routine lifestyle is important to deal with daily challenges in domestic life. Adapting new attitudes of young people  could be beneficial for the parents to keep their relationship healthy. For instance, a survey report by The Society shows that those parents who make subtle changes in their views and behaviour toward  their children have great bonding with their children. As a result, the complication in their family reduces with this kind of improvement in daily life.",
        "Secondly, it is clear that the way we used to work has changed a lot in different aspects and the important role played by  technology. This development force almost every employee to learn new things to get better performance. For example, in the 1980s we do not have many computers at work, so ,,usually people had to use conventional way to complete their task, however, these days laptops and computer system is common in almost all  workplace to carry out their projects. On contrary, those employees who fail to adopt this change may be laid out by the employer.",
        "In conclusion, although people love to stay in their comfort zone by keep doing the same what they have been doing, my view is to make necessary transformations that could help us to get better outcomes."
