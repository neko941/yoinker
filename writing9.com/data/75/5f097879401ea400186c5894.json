        "As we can see in these days that many museums charge people for the entry in order to get inside, while some of them provide free entering for the people. From my point of view, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages for many reasons, described in the following paragraphs.",
        "One of the problems is many youths that want to observe the collections for gaining inspiration will not have sufficient money for getting into the museum due to the facts that they are still at school, and do not have income from working. Therefore, they will have to find other ways of increasing their motivation about the art, for instance, the reliable website on the internet or the teachers from the school. However, those methods of finding arts can be led to the problem of the museum about lacking money for helping its place to be safe by hiring the officers.",
        "On the other hand, charging for admission is capable of scanning the people, which is necessary for its value of the arts that can be easily broken from the surroundings and people, for example, some people that want to get in only for just pranking others without taking care the place. And, if the collections are destroyed, the museum is the one who needs to pay for the artist, which is really expensive. Moreover, the museum can send some parts of the money for advocating the artists in order to help increasing them the inspiration. Thus, all of us will have many new works from them in the future.",
        "In conclusion, getting the money for the people before they get into the museum offers more benefits than drawbacks. It is true that it can be a negative effect on its owner, but it can also aid them supporting the works of artists by securing them and sending them the money."
