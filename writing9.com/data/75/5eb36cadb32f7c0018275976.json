        "Staying healthy is important for any human being. Besides physical health, one has to maintain a good mental health in order to have a balanced life. Some believe people have to do activities such as reading and solving word puzzles in their leisure time to improve the mind. On the contrary, others believe taking a complete rest is vital. This essay will discuss both viewpoints and will end with personal opinions on the topic.",
        "Firstly, many brain exercises are proven to improve mental health conditions. For example, doing word puzzles is not only a mind relaxing activity for many people but also an excellent exercise to improve human memory. Hence, it is understandable as to why doing such activities in leisure time is highly recommended by a significant number of people.",
        "Next, taking enough rest, especially for the brain, is also important. Undoubtedly, the brain is one of the most important organs. Under prolonged stress conditions, it can malfunction. As a result, people have to suffer lots of mental disorders which in turn lead to dysfunction of the whole body. Therefore, giving sufficient rest to the brain by stopping doing brain related activities during leisure time is essential.",
        "In conclusion, people should regularly do mental improvement exercises when they have free time. Besides that, they also have to make sure enough rest is given to the brain by taking complete rest when they are tired. Personally, it is believed that doing word puzzles or any other brain related exercises in spare time is healthy and when people feel tired, they should take full rest before doing any other things."
