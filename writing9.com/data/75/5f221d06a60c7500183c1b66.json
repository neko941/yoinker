        "Sound health plays very important role in the human life and his work performance. Some companies think that, offering the membership of gym or sports clubs to their staff is can bring many benefits to the company while many other employers see no advantage in doing so. There are both pros and cons in this thinking which will be discussed in detail here.",
        "In the beginning, it is undeniable that Gym and sports can make a person healthier and not only physically, but it can also give the positive effect on the mental health of people. It can bring some long term benefits to the company. For instance, a healthy person will take less sick leaves and will be able to job more efficiently. Furthermore, sports are the best way to build team spirit and promote interpersonal skills. Moreover, sports club sponsorship by companies will implicitly convey the message that employers do care about the wellness of their employees alongside profit-making. Perhaps, employees will pay extra effort at job if they are valued.",
        "On the contrary, some managers think it as a useless offer to give and they are also not entirely wrong too. Many other direct facilities are more efficient than these. Payment increment, less work hours, holiday sponsorship and reasonable workloads are the main paths for showing care to their workers.  If employees\u2019 performances are directly linked to their pay increments or career progression, they should have enough tangible rewards to work effectively. Likewise, if workers are able to identify meaningful goals or get job satisfaction, they should have intrinsic motivation to excel in performance. For instance, studies show that employees work more enthusiastically when they are motivated and are awarded rather than having facilities like gyms.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that gyms or sports club membership offered by the office is one of the many effective motivations for some employees to perform effectively at work. But for many others monetary or other tangible or intangible rewards are more effective. It is expected that employers will provide a range of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators that will promote productivity at job."
