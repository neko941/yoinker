        "In recent decades, violence in movies and on televisions has been inspiring some fear among the public due to its implications for the community. Some people believe that the authorities should impose censorship on such movies and TV programmes to reduce crime rates. Although this idea appears reasonable, it cannot be viewed as the ultimate approach for the government to reduce violent crimes in today\u2019s society. In this essay, some reasons supporting this view will be discussed.",
        "It is true that brutal scenes delivered by the media would potentially have positive effects on children\u2019s minds and people\u2019s behaviour since they provide some important life lessons. For instance,  the film \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d, which contains a large number of violent scenes, is also a story about power, family and humanity. Therefore, it gets much appreciation in the society for its substance. As a result, it seems unnecessary for the authorities limit the amount of violence in films and on televisions.",
        "It is believed that the government should take other measures instead of censoring the duration of violent scenes in the media to reduce crimes in the society. In fact, extreme poverty and despair are more likely than media violence to drive a person to commit a crime. As a result, it is crucial that the authorities should promote more social welfare in order to prevent people from violent behaviour. Thus, it is unimportant to control the amount of violence in films, although it may have a few negative impacts on public awareness.",
        "In conclusion, violence in movies and on televisions is not completely responsible for increasing crime rates in the society. It is recommended that the government should improve living conditions of citizens to decrease the violent crimes in the society."
