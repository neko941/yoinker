        "There has been a controversy about whether entertainers, such as film stars, are paid too much. I agree with this argument, and my reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs.",
        "First, they serve as a negative example for the younger generation. It's expected that a well-paid job always needs high education and excellent abilities; high education is of the utmost importance in the job market because it can examine your skills to a large extent. Therefore, in order to attain diplomas, people have to study arduously and the process can be challenging. However, the advent of entertainers makes people's efforts pointless because they break the regular role that getting a lucrative job doesn't need diplomas anymore. At this point, the younger generation might be affected and start disdaining diplomas.",
        "Second, causing dissatisfaction among the general public. It's commonplace that every occupation has its income limit; people who engage in this job can't have a salary beyond this limit. Nevertheless, the income of celebrities has become invisible these years; in other words, they are scared to let people know their real income. At this point, it's bound to happen that there will be an unsatisfactory emotion among the general public if the income of celebrities is revealed. As a result, such a situation might damage the harmony of society as well because there might be some protests against entertainers on account of their astounding wages.",
        "On the other hand, there are occupations which are deserved to be paid well. For instance, doctors and scientists.  As we know, the process of becoming a doctor is difficult and arduous, and due to the importance of doctors, they are always asked to work overtime. Thus, these respectful jobs are deserved to be paid well to match their contributions.",
        "In conclusion, I believe entertainers shouldn't be paid this high and there are other occupations that should be paid highly."
