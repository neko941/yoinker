        "Undoubtedly, our planet is getting affected drastically day by day due to many reasons. Some people believe that pollution is one of the main reasons. However, I believe that there are many problems\u00a0which are causing issues. I completely agree that everyone should take serious action\u00a0to save our earth for future generations by\u00a0contributing\u00a0in different ways.",
        "Firstly, the most significant cause\u00a0is air pollution. It has been observed that the number of vehicles has increased significantly on the roads which\u00a0becoming a reason for global warming. For instance, in this modern time, now every member of the family keeps a separate car to commute to their work location. Everyone has to use public transport in order to reduce the\u00a0rush on the\u00a0roads which, in turn, helps to save more trees as there\u00a0will be no need to expand the\u00a0roads to\u00a0handle large traffic.",
        "Another reason which is affecting our planet is the toxic gases and unhandled waste released from the factories which also pollute the water\u00a0bodies. It should be the government's responsibility\u00a0to make some rules so that water cannot be get contaminated. Moreover, It has been observed that real estate development\u00a0has increased at a higher ratio as compared to the past to fulfil the needs of human beings to provide them shelter which also becoming a reason to destroy nature. Being responsible citizens, we have to choose a vertical building\u00a0to live in and every person has to plant at least\u00a0one tree in their homes.",
        "Furthermore, Regulatory bodies should have to run campaigns to teach all denizens about the importance of nature and award them if they take initiatives to save the environment\u00a0and give an idea of how we can use fewer resources to save the earth effectively. Other than that government should inculcate some methods of a simple living in schools as children\u00a0learn at a fast pace than youngsters.",
        "In conclusion, although it is a common belief that many actions\u00a0taken\u00a0by the common man affect\u00a0the globe. I believe each individual should put an effort\u00a0in order to preserve water channels and nature which can save the planet for posterity. Personally, I think regulatory bodies should make some rules and guidelines to common people to make them understand the importance of our earth."
