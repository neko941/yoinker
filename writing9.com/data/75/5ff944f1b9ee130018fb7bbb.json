        "People use various mother tongue and it varies on the asymmetrical state where they can make a link with each other to continue their daily tasks and cultural activities. It would be convenient if folks can only use a unique language to apprehend themselves conveniently. There are both merits and demerits of this argument. From my perspective, there may be an enormous disadvantage than advantage if people would use the same language.",
        "One of the positive of using the same language is to communicate with each other it would be felt relieved. Not only that they would be relaxed but also it would be the easiest way to make a relationship with anyone at the same time. As they are habituated by the same accent, they could comprehend easily. As a result, it would be flexible for them to do any tasks. They can share their feelings in the same way. Thus, they could fashion themselves which would bring a fruitful result for them. For instance, if a person wants to create a shop in his area it would be very helpful for others. It is because they can swap the same tongue where they can use it in their daily life.",
        "Despite all of the positive sides, it is required to express different languages. Firstly, there must be in diversity to do any tasks. Secondly, innovative would be expressed if there is a variation of using different types of accents. People have to travel to each other. By knowing themselves, if they possess same expression they cannot comprehend themselves and it could impact a terrible effect in every side like as social, religion, economical etcetera. For example, a person knowing the same type of speech cannot travel everywhere and as a consequence, it would not be possible for him to get a fruitful result.",
        "In conclusion, to rule in one area the same tongue is compatible. However, to reign all over world, there is no alternative way to learn different types of languages. If there is a trend only learn the same language there is no travelling all over the world which would make a person's life monotonous."
