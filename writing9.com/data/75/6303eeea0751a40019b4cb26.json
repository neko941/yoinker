        "There is no denying the fact that the role of distance-learning programs is debatable. For instance, Some people think attending colleges or universities has more benefits than studying at home.",
        "In my opinion, I consider that distance-learning programs can bring more benefits to the student than having the need to attend the class itself at the university. While it is a commonly held belief that studying at home can be challenging, however, it has proven its efficiency in the student's life. It can be considered a time-saving method, where much time can be saved by avoiding commuting, waiting, or getting ready. Moreover, it helps the student to focus more during the class, due to fewer distractions from other students, or the environment itself.",
        "There is also an argument that attending classes at the university was the traditional way back days, where for some people it was considered the best way to learn. An instance of this is the commitment to time and deadlines, where attending classes can be the first place that will help students to develop this skill. Equally important is that students can meet their mentors in person, which can enhance the trust in the relationship between them. In addition, students can sign up for activities and events, or they can join various types of clubs such as Football, Chess, or even Photography.",
        "To conclude , I think both of the learning methods are significantly affecting the student's university life. Personally, I think that a merge of the two methods can be more effective and will reflect much brighter results."
