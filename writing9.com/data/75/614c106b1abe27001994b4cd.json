        "Nowadays computer education has become mandatory to survive in this world. Some people believe that it should be compulsory at the school level while others think that kids can learn computers from daily interaction. I believe that incorporating computer education in the school curriculum helps kids to learn computers from a basic level and excel in the same.",
        "Firstly, by making computer education mandatory at the school level, it helps students to be enthusiastic about computers. In schools all the subjects will be treated with equal care and children think that computers are equally important as other subjects like math and science. For example, schools have a well-designed curriculum for all subjects and when computers become one of the students automatically tend to cope up with computers as other subjects which helps them further in their careers.",
        "Secondly, in today's world most of the jobs are based on computers. With computers ruling the world there are many jobs created from operator level to engineering concepts. So having basic knowledge of computers at the school level helps students to choose computers as their career options. For instance, a child is taught computers at school level and he is given basic  graphics then he can choose a career out of graphic designing which is one of the booming jobs in the present market. With proper planning of schools in the curriculum of children subjects, they can make wonders in the field of computers.",
        "To conclude, it is mandatory to make computer education at the school level so that children can make the best out of computers. It helps them to keep up with the competition in the computer world."
