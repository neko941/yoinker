        "From the beginning of the modern age, people started to rely more on the consumer goods. With the passage of time, this need grows rapidly. As a result, it became the most important part of people\u2019s lives. Generally speaking, using manufacturers' goods is less time consuming. But there are many side effects which need to be considered, first.",
        "Consumer goods are the main part of people\u2019s lives and cannot be omitted. But in order to decide whether to bring any specific product into our life, one should weigh the disadvantages over the advantages.",
        "Like any other issue, using consumer goods have its pros and cons. The best advantage is that, they are ready to use and almost available everywhere. So the purchaser must spend little precious time providing them. In my opinion, there are more merits to consumer durable goods in comparison to non-durable ones. Durable final products such as cars, home furniture and clothing can last a lifetime and will ease the people\u2019s lives. They have low to zero harm on humans\u2019 personal well-being. On the contrary, nondurable goods which mainly consist of foods can have a lot of side effects on people\u2019s health. For instance, these foods are tending to be more inorganic and they mostly contain additives to widen their life span. Therefore, they can put people\u2019s health in danger. As it is always said, \u201cNothing is more valuable than people\u2019s health.\u201d",
        "To sum up the points, it can be mentioned that, manufacturers\u2019 goods are essential in people\u2019s lives. But one must not completely depend on them. Generally speaking, people must buy products which their merits outweigh the demerits and will cause no harm to their lives. This is a personal decision which one has to do sensibly according to their lifestyle."
