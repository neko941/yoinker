        "Currently, Population is considered as the backbone for a nation's economy.Few nations are having more  youth residents compared to senior citizens. In this essay, I will discuss the merits of having a younger influence and a few of their negative impact.",
        "Firstly, young adults are more flexible and can do work in any sector. They are capable to take most difficult tasks in industries. Earlier, In most of the nations women were not allowed to work in industries, as pilots and as engineers etc., However, the trend has changed now women started working as airforce pilots, engineers and also many more were serving in the army. Younger generations will vital role in increasing the economy of the country, Moreover if the countries having more adults population is one of the key points to many multinational companies to set up their companies As a result, adults will get many opportunities to work. By this, their family standard of living will be improved. Again this will help to boost the GDP of the country.",
        "Secondly, Younger generations need to be more skilful in their work. They need to start working towards their passion to reach greater heights. A very good example is a well-known cricket player Sachin Tendulkar(Former Indian cricket team captain). In his childhood his father came to know Sachin's passion for cricket, so his father helped him to pursue his passion soon later, under Sachin's captaincy India won a world cup. So young adults of every country will have an added advantage.",
        "Thirdly, Adults will surely help the nation financially. But, Also the unemployment rate will leap. for instance, A renowned newspaper in India published that, Every year around 10 lakh young engineers are graduated from college. Meanwhile, only 3 lakhs are getting  jobs in their respective fields. As a consequence, the unemployment rate will be increased. So this may be a demerit for having a more young population.",
        "In conclusion, the Adult population can make countries stronger in terms of economy, but also have some disadvantages, like unemployment. From my point of view, we have many advantages compared to disadvantages of having a young population."
