        "Nowadays , numerous species are being lost by  environmental problems and also many more will become extinct so this essay illustrates the reason and solution for the above statement.",
        "First of all , people are hunting animals due to get their expensive things like leathers , nails and teeth , on the contrary , they do not think that one day it will cease to exist, for example, a number of wildlife species , we can see only in the zoo , consequently , it disturbs the process of the environment. Moreover , a plethora of people's mistakes, the situation like wildfire is created in the forest  , in addition , it harmful all over the wildfire , who lives in the forest , such as last year , it was created by humans in the African forest and it was started by just one piece of cigarette , as a result , which hunted thousands of animals and some of them were very rare to see.",
        "On the other hand , the government should work on it and the area where animals live should be restricted to the public , for instance , currently , a number of areas are there , which is not allowed to go people , as a result , wildlife lives peacefully without us. Secondly , whenever  wildfires start at that time fire workers come immediately to solve this problem , for example , many countries have a good fire system to stop and as a result , they can easily stop and save them.",
        "In conclusion , it is not only the government's responsibility they are also our part of life to save them and take care of the environment and everyone must not disturb their life."
