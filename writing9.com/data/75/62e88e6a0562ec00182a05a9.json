        "There is no denying that the economy plays an essential role in a country's prosperity. However, there are other factors also be considered important. This essay will discuss some factors which affect a country the most. In my opinion, all of the factors are equally vital for a country.",
        "For one thing, culture is seen as the soul of a country. Culture represents a country because people can distinguish different countries by realizing their culture. For example, we can easily compare the differences between western and eastern countries. For another thing, history is also an important factor for a country. People can learn mistakes from their ancestors and prevent them from happening again. For instance, we can do some research on some civilizations, and get to know how they become prosperous and weak. In addition, humans can also learn some useful knowledge from their ancestors such as how to build a house or grow crops.",
        "For the last thing, the government also plays a key role in a country. Government is just like the human heart, a country cannot operate smoothly without it. Furthermore, we not only need the existence of the government but also need laws to restrict it, or the government might make some negative effects on a country. Take Sri Lanka for example. The country went bankrupt recently because of their corrupt government.",
        "In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, in order to become a successful country, all these factors are indispensable. Without one of them, a country might just be a small country rather than a successful one. Therefore, there is no such factor that is better than others."
