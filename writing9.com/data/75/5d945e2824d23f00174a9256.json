Moreover, students can also able to make their own time schedule. Therefore, it provides the facility of super flexibility.",
        "On the other hand, there are numerous reasons for the effectiveness of face-to-face learning. First and the foremost is that, teachers will be able to monitor the how much student has learned, so that one can be able to pay attention more  if need to particular area to the pupil.  Secondly, studying through physical presence in the institute has helped them to communicate with their tutor and their peers. Therefore, one will acquire the interpersonal skill. Last but not the least, is that tutor can access the child from the every aspect of the curriculum. Therefore, it makes the student to become sophisticated and cognitive which would be fruitful for their future and occupation. Hence, studying in the institute is necessary for holistic development of the pupil.",
        "To conclude, it has been seen that the internet is useful only for those who have certain difficulty to attend the class, but it cannot  take place off school in the life of an individual as it is important for holistic development of an individual."
