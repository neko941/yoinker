        "There is no denying the fact that the take care of a child should be the responsibility of their guardians. Therefore, I agree with the aforementioned notion because the father and mother both are legally responsible for the activities which their adolescents perform. In future, if something happens  good or bad so all credit will be given to their parents.",
        "It is true that parents play an indispensable role in children's lives from the birth of them. In addition, by spending time with parents and grandparents children can learn so many skills which can facilitate fight with day to day mishappenings in this competitive world because  if their parents provide piece adequate knowledge to their pillars so it will be easier for them to face competitions and some bad situations in life. Thus, parents' supervision is important in their child's life because they are responsible for nurturing their children.",
        "Moreover, children can learn driving, cooking, and saving from their parents which not only paves the way to learn new and good skills but also help them to be creative and talented. Additionally, choosing a good career path is also guided by their parents sometimes because their parents force and allow them to do something which is  best for them. Moreover, they should provide about the rules and regulations of their country. For instance, if a child performs driving in under teenage so on that it will illegal because a law has made about the age limit to drive any vehicle. However, if they will do so punishment and penalty will be given to their guardians.",
        "In the conclusion, children can learn so many things from their parents and it should only be the responsibility of guardians to take care of their child because all the things performed by them no matter what is good or bad always given to the family's account."
