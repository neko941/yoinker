        "I am writing this letter to you with regard to the advertisement posted in the local newspaper about the master\u2019s scholarship program. I am a 2nd year post-graduate student of computer programming from JNTU university. I would like to apply for this scholarship, as I believe that I can prove my competency for the scholarship.",
        "I participate in all the extra-curricular activities at the university. Also, I was responsible for organizing these activities during college annual festival. In fact, I was chosen for this role by all the professors, among 1200 students. Moreover, I am the captain of the football team, and we won all the matches against other universities, which secured us a place in next year\u2019s Olympics.",
        "I received all \u2018A\u2019 grades in my first year of post-graduation. In spite of my participation in extra-curricular activities, I performed exceptionally well in my academics, and I am confident that I will continue the same for rest of my years at the university. I am enclosing a few of my professor\u2019s feedback on me which might be useful for you while reviewing my application.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
