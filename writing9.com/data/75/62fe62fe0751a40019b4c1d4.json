        "Some day all transportation options will not need a driver and these tools will be used by only people who are  travellers. In my opinion, this situation will create many kinds of advantages for  society such as diminishing  traffic congestion and decreasing  human errors.",
        "The first advantage of using driverless vehicles in the transportation network is reducing  traffic issues. Transportation is part of daily life and many people have been consuming their generation in traffic jams for a long time. However, if we have a chance  the use  driverless cars, this improvement will solve wasting of time. For instance, driverless car technology will provide a connection between other cars and freight lights at the same time. Moreover, these automobiles are managed by artificial intelligence as well as calculating optimum circumstances composed with an instant time. All these benefits will make our life easier.",
        "The second advantage of giving a place for driverless cars in the transport industry is the minimizing of human errors. Many families believe that they make a conscious decision. Nevertheless, society has emotions and limited attention spans. In this case, driverless cars have already ensured to figure out this problem. For example, many populations have rushed to their priorities such as one person  getting to work or delivering  packages. On the other hand,  utilizing cars which have no driver has obeyed the rules and never decided with a subjective perspective.",
        "In conclusion, many people assume that cars which do not need a driver are not trustful because of many reasons. Despite knowing this, this technology which is the best sustainable solution for  traffic gives  many kinds of opportunities. If we had a chance  the adapt this progress, it would be an effective and sufficient advancement for  our society."
