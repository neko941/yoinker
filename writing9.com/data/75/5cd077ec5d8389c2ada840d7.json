I would like to inform you that I have joined office last Thursday after taking a 10-day official trip to Kulalampur, Malaysia for \"Unleash 2019\" conference. Now I am seeking your permission to show a computer-based presentation on \"How and why of Frugal Innovation\".",
        "How much do we know about creating and sustaining frugal innovations? That was the exact question the audience were having in the conference. It will take approximately 2 hours to finish my entire presentation which will answer this question to our colleagues as well, especially in terms of the origin of an idea in low-cost, implementation, and the future of it.",
        "We may think of inviting people not only from our department but also from other pertinent sectors. However, as the conference hall of building A will be fully booked from 18th to 20th December, I altered the location into meeting room 1 of the same building.",
        "Appreciate your time and effort on this. I look forward to receiving your permission at your earliest convenience.",
