        "Some people think that learning a foreign language can be useful just for travelling or working. Others, however, say that numerous reasons can exist for a person to learn a new language. I agree with the second point of view, and I believe there are several crucial reasons that can make people interested in being bilingual.",
        "It is true that one of the main reasons for learning a new language can be finding a job or travelling. The majority of people who tend to work in abroad have to learn the mother tongue of the destination country, and this is an undeniable fact. For example, an individual who wants to work in the USA should learn how to communicate in English, because without this skill he can not be successful. In contrast, acquiring a new language just for travelling is not a reasonable decision as there are many interpreters who can help you to enjoy your journey without worrying about language.",
        "There are several critical reasons why people tend to acquire a foreign language. Firstly, studying abroad can be a crucial issue for many people. For instance, the majority of people in my country learn English as a second language due to applying to international universities. Learning a foreign language for this purpose is much more important than travelling. Secondly, understanding the culture of a certain country might be a good purpose for individuals. a person who wants to be familiar deeply with a special culture and its history should learn the way that native people speak.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that studying and working can be important reasons for learning a foreign language, but each person has their own critics for this."
