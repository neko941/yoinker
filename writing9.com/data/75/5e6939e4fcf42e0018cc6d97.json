        "When it comes to proper ways we should cultivate our children, it is often argued that ideas coming from elderlies, such as the way a person should think, live or behave, are not compatible with the way youngsters need in the modern life. While I believe that some old values should be kept and be educated to teenagers, I see eye-to-eye with those who claim this assertion, as I believe that due to our fast-changing world, some old methods of living are not suitable in upbringing of children.",
        "On the one hand, moral values that are important for old-timers should be preserved. In other words, we can see in our society that older peoples' interaction with others are built based on a respectful and appropriate manner, which is vital for communities and must be passed to next generations. Behaviours such as respecting old people, women and neighbours or ideas like not showing discrimination against other races or hatred thoughts are some examples that are of a paramount importance for elderlies.",
        "On the other hand, some seniors ideas seem to be outdated and hard to be adapted to the new generation life. It means that, because of different ways of living, there are some values that do not make sense in this present climate. Therefore, thoughts such as gender roles (men as breadwinners and women as housewives), working hard in difficult situations, going to bed before midnight and wake up in the early morning, and other old-fashioned ideas do not usually match to the way we live today.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, not only are those old ideas of which are related to manner and behaviours needed to be preserved, but they also required to be thought for next generations. Conversely, we have to forget about those old-fashioned living styles and ideas which are barely helpful and make any bettering in next generation lives."
