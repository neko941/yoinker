        "There are some arguments about teaching children how to be positive people in society. There is a choice between family and school about who should prepare them. Both of them play a significant role in developing children\u2019s social life, but in my opinion schools are in charge of helping them.",
        "Family is the first thing that a child notices it at first. Children spend most of their time at home and they communicate with their parents and siblings. Due to this reason, family impacts children in a lot of aspects such as social life. Also teenagers believe that their family is trustworthy and the relationships are strong enough to learn social skills from them. Although parents always want the best for their children, they are not skilled in this subject and sometimes have a conflict about social needs for their children.",
        "The first place that children start to know the real world is schools. Students most of the time find their best friends at school. It is obvious that friends have the highest influence on people. Due to that, they have to learn good things about society. Additionally, students can experience the lessons about social life at school. For example, schools can hold a workshop about good people in society and children can feel it. In my opinion, schools are the most important factor for introducing the society.",
        "In conclusion, albeit children spend a large proportion of their time at home, friends have the highest impact on them. So schools are the main source for teaching children about the good society."
