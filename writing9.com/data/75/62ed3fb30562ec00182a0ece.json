        "These days, accessing the data and news become much easier because of the mass media. Mass media such as Television, newspaper and the Internet are accessible from almost every part of the world. Many people believe that some restriction in accessing information is needed, whereas others argued that media freedom is an essential factor for democracy. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and I will express my opinion that why I do not think the government\u2019s censorship is acceptable.",
        "Some people claim that broadcast and media should be controlled and banned in some cases. It is their view that government is responsible for some violent and fraud sites and channels. So, by curbing this content threats will be diminished. Moreover,  some countries' governments prefer to censor some social media and news channels which narrate opposed ideas. For instance, in North Korea due to the propagation of their false beliefs, there is no live-stream foreign program on national TV.",
        "A growing number of people believe that governments have not the right to control media. Because being able to access all information is  one of the main factors of democracy and freedom in a society. That is to say, among lots of channels to flicks and web pages to surf people can choose their favourite ones intellectually. Although free media is substantial for a community, parents should be able to restrict some inappropriate and illegal subjects for their immature children to decrease the risk of media on their family.",
        "In conclusion, media is a kind of double-edged sword that can be used in a positive and negative way. It can be controlled by governments due to political and security purposes, also it can be freely accessible to respect human rights. Personally, I think in the modern era clarity  highly matters and free media is one of the major aspects of achieving  clarification and a democratic society."
