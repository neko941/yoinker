        "Nowadays, the prohibition of smoking in public places is a controversial topic. Some countries have established ban laws on smoking in public places, while others have no intention of doing it. This essay will discuss the debate and give a conclusion view.",
        "On the one hand, those who support the forbiddance of smoking tobacco in public places promote the idea that smoking in these places encourages increasing tobacco consumption. It means that people will be encouraged to smoke. For example, youth and children are usually present in public sites like restaurants, so they will be curious about smoking and encouraged to try it. Furthermore, proponents of prohibition claim that smoking in public locations negatively affects social health and increases the number of patients. In other words, cigarette smoke spreads in general sites and will affect the health of the present population. For instance, employees of an office will get health problems because they spend a long time under the influence of tobacco smoke. To supporters of this Idea, the benefits of this law are convincing.",
        "On the other hand, opponents of cigarette smoking prohibition can cite that this law will cause recessions. The  law might reduce the consumption of tobacco. Consequently, tobacco trading would be faced with a decrease; for example, the countries which earn money by exporting tobacco confront financial bankruptcy. In addition, critics also highlight the employees\u2019 problems in their office because some of them become addicted to smoking cigarettes to increase their concentration during their work, so because of smoking prohibition, they might not be able to do their jobs well. This argument also appears to be quite powerful.",
        "In conclusion, I would tend to side with the proponents of establishing laws against smoking. It seems that this law will promote public health. Although some say that national financial matters could be destroyed, healthy people will be able to solve this problem."
