        "There was a lengthy dispute about whether people should brace a poor job or lack of money, or seek for a chance to improve the situation. I believe that we should accept the situation and try to promote it.",
        "The argument of approving that bad status are the best choices for us is that we need to know the difference between current ability and our target point. When we find a phenomenon with a negative impact on us, we ought to analyse why something bad happened. For example, if someone does not have enough money, accept and then analysing their cash flow is the best avenue to detect how money goes out. At the same time, they could prevent from money depleting too fast to stack in an embarrassing situation with the same spending pattern. On the other hand, we cannot raise ourselves with financial support from jobs. In an exactly perfect example, a job which does not meet your demand does not mean that it is not important for your material life.",
        "Admittedly, pursuing an ideal job or lifestyle is as same essential as accepting a bad situation. Firstly, followed by the example I mentioned about lack of money, analysing and saving money is a tool to constrain the output flow, while seeking for a better method to earn money is an approach to increase the input flow. If they only want to save money without earning money, their lifestyle might be harsh, struggling and unhappy. Secondly, more opportunities are likely to appear if we attempt more in it. For instance, if one does not have much interest in it, they are not prone to concentrate on full attention on their job, that is to say, they might not obtain some sense of achievement or fulfilment.",
        "In conclusion, it is indisputable that we have to accept current situations when we do not have a better choice, while, if possible, we ought to try our best to enhance our life status and situations."
