        "It's a dream for many people to build a residence in their life time. However, some argue that the government should offer free houses to the general public while, I partially disagree with the statement and believe that the authorities should not provide housing for completely free.",
        "There is a conception that national bodies should provide free home for the poor people who are not financially capable to buy a house on their own, however it will have more negative consequences, because it will lead to the financial burden on the regulatory bodies  and it will impact on the budgeting of other essential sectors. For instance, if the ministry decides to fund all the citizens for housing for free, then they will have to lower the budget for important sectors like defence, healthcare, development work, infrastructure work as the majority of their budget will be spent on housing for all the individuals. Not only these departments will see less budgeting for many years but, they will face issues at the rate at which they are executing their work. Therefore, it is a bad idea to provide  completely free housing for the poor people.",
        "On the other side, it is the prime duty of the administration to help the citizen of its nation and  housing should be one of the basic requirements. However, I am completely opposed of this view,  that ministry should provide free flats to its people, but I think authority can give partial help to its people by supporting them financially with half of the money of the regime and half of the money of its citizens to build their home. For example, In India union has launched Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna in which state provides subsidy for the economically poor section of society as well as a loan at a very low interest rate to build their house, these types of scheme can help economically weaker class to build their own home.",
        "To conclude, to fulfil the dreams of its citizen, is the responsibility of administration and it can be achieved by partially helping poor people by giving them half the cost of the financial assistance of their house."
