After amplifying themselves with the quality, the possibility of people to change their jobs for better salaries and lifestyle is getting higher. For instance, start-up company has become popular owing to the fact that they can provide a more challenging atmosphere and a competitive salary, but the company requires merit for employing workers. Therefore, when the people meet this requirement, they will tend to move and shift their jobs due to the reason that they need more favourable salaries.",

By that, an individual could maintain his pace of work and life gradually, and therefore, would have a better work life balance.

Thus, if the individual can stick to these approaches, it will result to a competitive and stabilized work ambiance."
