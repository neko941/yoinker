        "Exploring the outside world beyond the earth has been one of the greatest work of mankind. There are views related to it,that exploring the space is a necessity for  future generations. However,there is some contradiction to same, saying if we don't find any necessary outcome as part of it,it's not a useful exploration.",
        "Presently, we have seen a great deal of money and resource spent to find more about various planets beyond our Earth. This is justified with the argument, that as more and more natural calamities and greenhouse issues are occurring on our mother earth , and if,for some reason, our planet becomes inhabitant for survival; we need to find some alternative in which we can survive likewise our globe to lead an habitant life. Moreover, with the exploration in space,we get to know if there are any other organisms present.",
        "However,there is a certain section of society which feels the cost associated with finding new territories beyond our globe is not helpful if we don't get any fruitful end result. The same money and resources can be used for existing world issues like poverty,water crisis and child welfare. This will help to improve the quality of contemporary human being.",
        "As a conclusion, we should ideally keep a bridge between  both the sources. We should try and keep exploring the new nature beyond our current one as that's needed for the safety and security of our upcoming generation. Also, at the same time,we need to divert or keep funds to be used in solving current nature issues."
