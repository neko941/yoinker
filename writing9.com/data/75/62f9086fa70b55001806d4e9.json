        "However, very unfortunately, it is not possible for me to come to the wedding. This is because the European Union has banned all nationals of my country from entering, making my visa invalid all of a sudden. Would the engagement party take place somewhere else, I would be really thrilled to attend.",
        "Nevertheless, despite the fact that I can't make it in person, there is still a way for me to participate in the celebration. I remember when a few years ago you told me that you would need a huge TV screen once you marry, so you can enjoy movies to full extent together with your spouse. I've decided to turn your dream into reality and ordered the biggest consumer-grade screen that I could find on the market. You will definitely enjoy it! Please let me know your new address, so that I know where it has to be delivered.",
