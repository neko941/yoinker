        "Some argue that an art class is crucial for youngsters at  school, while others neglect its impact. It is a common belief that art is not necessary for primary school as fundamental knowledge is more important. However, I firmly believe that learning about art is more advantageous due to having creativity and mental development.",
        "On the one hand, it can be argued that art is useless when starting higher education. To explain more, subjects, such as mathematics and science, are considered crucial classes to enhance children's academic performance for applying to universities. Thus, spending more time on ordinary subjects to build solid academic backgrounds can be more significant rather than drawing or listening to music. In fact, primary school teachers in South Korea frequently mention that some students are doing maths homework from private institutions during the art classes as they treat the art as not helpful when it comes to tertiary education. Due to this tendency, it might be suggested that art can be replaced with more valuable classes.",
        "Considering this factor, I still think art can have many benefits, like enhancing creativity and being emotionally mature. When it comes to creativity, it can be improved when people are younger by conducting art activities. Young individuals can improve their creativity by drawing, which helps them to widely imagine and think childish. Putting their imaginations into the sketch provides confidence that they can create what they mind in their brain. Moreover, drawing and listening to classical music can also grow their psychological maturity. It is often suggested that many professional psychologists claim that it is helpful for children to experience a number of art activities. This causes youngsters to grow their patience and peacefulness. Consequently, art classes should not be avoided in primary schools due to these positive impacts.",
        "To conclude, although art might not be prioritised for university enrollment, it is still necessary for young individuals. This is because it can not only develop the ability of creative thinking but also enhance their mindful hearts. Therefore, I persist that art classes should be provided in all schools."
