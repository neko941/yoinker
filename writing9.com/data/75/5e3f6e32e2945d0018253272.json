        "In most civilised societies, grandchildren hardly spend time with their grandparents. This has a lot of implications, but I believe only a few really matters.",
        "To start with, there are lots of benefits of kid spending quality time with their  parents folks. First and foremost  the kids get to enjoy good stories about their heritage, which help them understand their roots and history. Secondly, knowledge and skill can be acquired as a result of spending much time the older folks. For instance, kids that visit their grandparents often tends to have very good  culinary skills and other home management know how. Finally, there is a high chance of more children being able to speak their native language if they get quality moments with their grandparent.",
        "In addition to this, lack of having quality moments with the grandparents will  lead to being lost by not  having a touch to kids roots and cultures, thereby causing diminishing of some essential traditions because it was not passed on. Also so many of those old skill will not learnt by these kids in particular, most kids lately cannot even cook",
        "To conclude, the benefits of spending more moments with grandparents will not be enjoyed by most children and the consequences are so great. However, the modernization of societies that causes grandchildren to spend little or no periods with the grandparents has lead to immense lost of heritage. Parents need to create avenues and opportunities for this young generation to have a feel of their roots and tradition of being with their grandparents."
