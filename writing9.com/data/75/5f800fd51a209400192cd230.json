I am starting to enjoy the work and weather here. However, I haven't started exploring the city yet. With my parent's anniversary arriving in another two days, I would need your advice on finding the perfect restaurant for a celebration.",
        "They are usually fond of traditional cuisines, especially non-veg food of Chettinad style. It will be a real surprise for them to get such food in Bangalore. I am also planning to make them exchange rings to remember their wedding day, in a serene place with a beautiful garden. Doesn't it sound perfect and dreamy? I am so excited.",
        "I have a vague memory of you letting me know about one such restaurant, where even the entire hotel had this traditional atmosphere and food being wonderful. Could you please write me the choices available here? I will make the reservations right away upon your response.",
