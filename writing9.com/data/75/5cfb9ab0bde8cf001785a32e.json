        "The tourism industry is one which has expanded extensively during recent times, as more people are inclined towards exploring the world. This surge has provided a vital opportunity for developing countries to improve their tourism sectors. This essay aims to shed light on the reasons behind this development, before discussing whether it is positive or not.",
        "First, let us take a look at the possible motives behind the expansion of the travel industry in developing nations. Since these countries are still developing, the primary reason for this could be to augment their revenue. For instance, in Northern India, cities with varied heritage have established tourist circuits, which are known to be frequented by thousands of people every day, and this has opened up a number of job opportunities for the natives. In addition to a significant profit, these advancements have also ensured the maintenance of monuments and heritage buildings by the government, and instilled a sense of pride in the general public towards their culture.",
        "Secondly, it is evident that this change is a positive one, as it has a substantial impact on several sectors, including hospitality. The money made through these advancements could be used to improve living conditions and healthcare. It has significantly increased efforts in the preservation and conservation of natural resources. For example, countries with forest reserves put extensive efforts into converting them into wildlife sanctuaries, which would ensure that the native species thrive in addition to being a source of income. As far as disadvantages like overcrowding and pollution go, mitigation methods could be taken by policy makers to ensure that the condition of living is not harmed.",
        "In conclusion, it is my belief that the expansion of the tourism sector is one that has numerous advantages to the economic well-being of developing countries. If the balance between public welfare and revenue collection is properly maintained, this change could prove monumental and possibly be their bridge to development."
