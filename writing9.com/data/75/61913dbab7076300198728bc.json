        "There is a controversial perspective heating a debate over the fact that successful people in society do not attribute their accomplishment to the theory they learn at an institution. While  this statement is valid to some certain extent, I still consider myself as an opponent of this notion.",
        "Undisputedly, there are numerous other factors that can make a person become successful in society such as, which are as crucial as theory. Communication skills are an important skill that can really help connect people with each other as well as with customers themselves. That makes each person's work more convenient and easier, making both parties feel  comfortable. For example, imagine that when working, the selected person does not have communication skills, it will make the customer feel that the company is unprofessional and does not want to accompany. Therefore, it is undeniable that communication skills have a very important role in the success of each person.",
        "Although other skills bring tremendous benefits, having good theoretical knowledge also contributes to one\u2019s success. There is a myriad of jobs requesting employees to have their foundation solid enough because some fields need a profound understanding of theory. For instance, the characteristics of basic science such as chemistry, biology require students to study in-depth theory so that they can be able to practice a lot in laboratories. Thus, theoretical knowledge has a significant role to play in people\u2019s accomplishments.",
        "In conclusion, there is a wealth of factors that contribute to the achievement of people and theory is one of the most essential elements that people shouldn\u2019t ignore."
