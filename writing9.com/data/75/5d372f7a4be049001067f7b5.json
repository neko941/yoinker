        "Tourism is promoted in many parts of the world. This essay will argue that the benefits of tourism offset the drawbacks, as it create more employment opportunities and contributes to the growth of a country's economy.",
        "One commonly cited disadvantage of tourism is that it could lead to the lost of cultural identity. When tourists regularly visit an area, the natives could start speaking in their language and copy their mode of dressing and way of life. For instance, the current trend in the dressing of teenagers in the United Arab Emirate has been attributed to the influence of western visitors in the country, which has gradually eroded the traditional dressing of the young natives. Therefore, tourism could result in a gradual cultural disintegration.",
        "Despite this, there are a number of advantages of tourism. First of all, it has improved the employment status of some countries. The growth of tourism has created many employment opportunities such as in the accommodation, security and transportation sectors of many nations, which has offered the citizens gainful employments. Secondly, tourism had improved the economy of many countries. These economic growths have been attributed to the movement of foreign exchange from wealthy countries to other parts of the world, where historical and tourist sites are located. For example, Egypt economy has been boosted by the yearly visits of tourist to the pyramids. Thus, tourism has contributed to the economic growth of some nations.",
        "In conclusion, although there are drawbacks to tourism, however, it is clear that it provides jobs for many people and it improves the economy of many countries. On the balance, there are more advantages of tourist acts than disadvantages."
