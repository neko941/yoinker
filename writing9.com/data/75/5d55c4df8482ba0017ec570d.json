        "It is widely suggested that libraries for the public are no more essential in this present era, while other people do not support this view. Although people can now obtain a wide range of information from the internet, I believe that public libraries are still important because they are the only source of some information.",
        "On the one hand, there are numerous information available on the internet. Many people now use electronic copies of books and do research mainly using their internet enabled devices such as phones and computers and this trend is on the rise. For instance, in recent years, many undergraduates in Nigeria who are conducting research depend mainly on the internet. Therefore, some people believe that since few people use public libraries now, they are no longer relevant.",
        "On the other hand, public libraries house many publications , which are yet to have electronic copies. Many library catalogues comprise textbooks, periodicals, research journals, audio and video cassettes as well as newspapers that have been used before the advent on the internet. Thus, they are the only providers of certain information. For examples, detailed information about the colonial era in Nigeria are provided by the Nigerian National Library. Although, the internet could reveal some of this information, however, they are often inadequate and inaccurate. Hence, public libraries are still important today and agree with this view.",
        "In conclusion, the internet is the source of many information today, as a result, some people think that public libraries are not important again. I disagree with the view, owing to the fact that public libraries are the custodian of many information that are not yet on the net. Efforts geared towards harnessing this benefit should be promoted."
