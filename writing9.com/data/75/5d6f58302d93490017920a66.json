        "It is said by some that car users ought to foot the costs of improving road systems due to the increasing number of cars, whereas others believe that this should be at the government\u2019s expense. In my opinion, I agree with the latter.",
        "On the one hand, there is a cause for the payment of car users. They are responsible for road systems improvement due to their breaches of weight restrictions. Users sometimes carry oversize loads or exceed the maximum number of people in cars, which leads to serious road damage. Therefore, as a way to protect the systems, they have to be fined for their lack of awareness. For instance, car users in Vietnam must pay more than one million VND when exceeding acceptable weight limits, partly contributing to the development of transport infrastructures.",
        "Despite the above-mentioned argument, others and I contend that the government should take responsibility for the costs for several reasons. Firstly, investment in infrastructures takes a huge amount of money, which is far beyond the car users\u2019 capability. Moreover, they have indirectly contributed to the enhancement by paying road taxes or fines, and part of national budgets comes from these payments. In addition, one of the government\u2019s essential roles is to provide citizens with better living standards, including the improvement of road systems. Thus, since the growing quantity of cars can make them downgraded, the government should spend more on their structures maintenance.",
        "In conclusion, although the idea that car users are financially responsible for enhancing the systems sounds feasible, I support that the disbursement has to be made by the government."
