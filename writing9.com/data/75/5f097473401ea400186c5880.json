        "With the passage of time and innovative marketing strategies, extreme sports are gaining in popularity. Some people argue that these kinds of sports like skiing and diving from the sky can be life-threatening and should be banned. This essay will discuss the core issues related to these risky sports and why I completely agree with the proposition.",
        "Playing intense sports can be very unsafe. Although these kinds of sports can give an adrenaline rush, the participants may lose their life during the game. The margin of safety while playing is minimal; a small mistake can cost a lot. In Australia, for instance, thirty people lost their lives last year, while skiing and half of those who signed up for skydiving had some form of minor abrasions or bruises. In short, sports that can endanger human life should be restricted.",
        "The second reason why these insane sports should be opposed is due to the lack of safety despite being expensive. Sports like scuba diving and parasailing are not only risky but are also costly. Many companies who arrange these sorts of sporting event charges a hefty amount of money from the customers to maintain and upgrade their facilities. This money, however, can be utilized in other more constructive activities like making a football stadium form which masses can take advantage. The Alpine football stadium is the prime example, which was built on a site reserved for skydiving to entertain local residents in 2015. Clearly, changing from intense sports to less expensive and safer sports is beneficial.",
        "This essay discussed the detrimental effects of intense sports and the hazards it can have on human life. In my opinion, restricting extreme sports is absolutely imperative and entirely justified."
