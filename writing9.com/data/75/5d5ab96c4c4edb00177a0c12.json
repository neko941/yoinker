        "Many people argue that with the increase in human\u2019s demands and the development of technologies, it is necessary for manufacturing new products after being tested on animals. I partly agree with previously mentioned perspective.",
        "To start with, there are two main reasons that make people agree with this opinion. There\u2019s no doubt that realistic tests are essential for people to understand how animals react toward the product. This could probably help them to have some certain adjustments such as cure or medical breakthroughs to reduce the negative effects on human beings. In addition, human\u2019s safety is obviously prioritized. For thousand years, men have contributed to the world\u2019s development in many ways. So animals should sacrifice for this sake of a greater creature, which also help in the world\u2019s innovation.",
        "However, in the digital era, I personally think that computer simulations are a possible alternative of animal tests. With the exact data, computer now can predict the reaction of human toward products with high accuracy, especially in transportation. Moreover, in the moral aspect, animals are not to be experienced to dead In some ways, animals should have rights as they help to keep biodiversity which can make the world become better in technological and modern ways. Therefore, they shouldn\u2019t be treated like that.",
        "In conclusion, this perspective is still a controversial problem. Some people believe that animals should be tested for human\u2019s safety while others does not. In my opinion, if technology is available, products should not be tested on animals but on modern devices."
