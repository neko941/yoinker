        "More contemporary adults are unlikely to follow the traditional pattern, to devote to some business. They began to choose to be self-employed for further careers. It might reasonable causes to this case. I would like to talk about this statement below.",
        "It is true to say that the people can take advantage of being self-employment. The restriction still is a dominant cause which a number of self-employment has increased. Although the smaller range of tasks requires a staff to follow, for some of modern adult, it is unacceptable and harsh for them. Especially for those graduates, they are reluctant to stay under plenty of rules and restraint. They hope to seek and explore ambition in the upcoming life. Moreover, being self-employed provides space for the people. They can handle affairs with innovate and free status. That is just an aspiration of the great majority of grown persons.",
        "Nevertheless, it is still risky by doing on owning. While the tasks won\u2019t be given continuously from the customers, this means that their incomes are always floating. When a person doesn\u2019t have a savings or sufficient income to support the career, it is meaningless to pursue the current circumstance. On the other hand, compare both of the situations, when the person entry an employment, the business is obligated to pay insurance and base salaries for them. Furthermore, devote to a business can guarantee constant payment.",
        "In summary, self-employment satisfies modern workers about their ideal careers. Albeit it is lower stressful for the adults, to be realistic. Steady income can guarantee the basic living standards for them."
