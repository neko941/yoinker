        "Students around the world have always been evaluated through tests and examinations during the school term. Could this method really be effective for their growth?  In this essay I will discuss why drawbacks outweigh the advantages of continuous testing pupils.",
        "To begin with, trials are not equal from school to school, and this does not allow an objective assessment of students as each test might have a different level of difficulty.  Two students with the same skills might obtain different results if assessed in different schools.    In addition, each professor has is own subjective way of assessing a test. How could that objectively reflect a scholar's real ability?  For instance, from my own experience, by doing the same test twice, I received two contrasting  votes from two  professors, and the final vote was the result of the statistical average between those votes.",
        "",
        "Another significant factor  to bear in mind is pressure.  Each one of us reacts individually, and not everybody  manages to handle it, especially during the first year of school. Moreover, it is known that anxiety is highly widespread among pupils: this psychological disturb will definitely affect negatively their results.   For example, a classmate of mine because of anxiety could not reach high votes in the first two years of high school as a result.  However, as soon as he managed to take control of his condition, he ended up with getting the best scores in the whole class.",
        "On the other hand, the actual system of evaluation applied by school might prepare pupils to be ready for either universities or their future jobs, where handling pressure and anxiety is required, in particular by companies.",
        "In conclusion, even though testing and examining characterises  today schools' principal aspect  that \"forges\"  students  so that they will be ready for their next steps, I personally believe that disadvantages prevails on advantages, and this approach will negatively reflect on scholars' results."
