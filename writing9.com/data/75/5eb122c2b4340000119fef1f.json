        "It is considered that many people believe that sending children to school at an early age is necessary, whereas others think that the age between 6 and 7 years are more preferable to learn new things. I personally believe that sending kids to school as early as possible is the best choice",

        "On the one hand, it is achievable to teach certain habits to kids at an early age, Such as, sharing  co-operation and socializing with others. These manners are easy to develop in schools rather than at home because nowadays both parents are working. Therefore, they do not have time to take care of their children. For instance, I remember that my teacher always told me to help needy people by giving them useful things that is how I learnt about sharing.",

For example, when I was in my childhood, I always used to take part in several events and competitions because these activities helped me to connect with unknown person which enhance my level of confidentiality.",
