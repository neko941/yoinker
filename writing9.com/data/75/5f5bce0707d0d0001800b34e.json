        "I am writing to let you know that I finally got a Software Engineer position at Google. I am so happy to share this news with you. As I told you earlier, my previous job was so bored with me. I kept working on fixing uncountable bugs of an existing system. Thus I started seeking new job opportunities 2 months ago.",
        "Since I walked in Google\u2019s office during my first interview, I immediately knew that this was my ideal workplace. My major responsibility is tuning search results on several The Google\u2019s products. The most exciting thing is that my supervisor is a pioneer in this area around the world. I believe that I can get enormous cutting-edge knowledge from him.",
        "Furthermore, I have bought a new house near my office. I sincerely invite you to come to visit next month if you are free at that point in time.",
