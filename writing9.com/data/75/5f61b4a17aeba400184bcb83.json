        "It is undeniable that which choice of major that university students should make to ensure a prospective future career has been a topic of discussion for years. While some people believe that it is best to let students freely choose what they want to study at university, others claim that only subjects which are related to science and technology should be favoured. This essay aims to discuss both views and then give the writer\u2019s opinions.",
        "On the one hand, there are an array of reasons why some people believe college students should have freedom in choosing whatever subject they enjoy. To begin with, the idea that students can pursue whatever they truly desire at educational institutions makes learning no longer a struggle but instead a pleasure. In fact, research has shown that a majority of college students who are able to study subjects of their choice enjoy the learning process and therefore achieve higher academic performances. Second, as these students can study what they believe they have a knack at, it is easier for them to make progress and sharpen their skills and expertise, which in turn turns them into great employees or workers for their future employers.",
        "On the other hand, the fact that some people think that it is better to force students to learn only science and technology- related subjects can be attributed to a host of reasons. First, in order to keep up with the pace of the progressive development of modern world, students should arm themselves with suitable knowledge of science and technology in order to land a decent job in a competitive labour market. In fact, as almost every area of development is related to well-developed technology, there are higher demands for these job vacancies and if students fail to show these skills or expertise, finding a good job can be a real challenge. Furthermore, as technology and science are the backbones of a country\u2019s economy, it is clearly beneficial for a country with lots of skilled workers with high levels of technological expertise.",
        "In conclusion, although the idea of letting students choose whatever major they like may sound plausible, I believe that they should only major in science and technology."
