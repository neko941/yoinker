        "It is argued that, higher authorities have the right to make improvements to the environment, and society cannot cooperate in this action. I completely disagree with this idea, and in this essay I will support my opinion with relevant examples.",
        "First of all, governments decide and control their country's well-being, moreover these institutions have the right to establish new rules in towns, which are made for the protection of the environment. However, the citizens, not always live by the rules, and sometimes they harm their surroundings. Like for instance, people often go to the parks or in the woods, where they litter, and leave their trash. This action has a negative impact on their habitat.",
        "The second reason why I disagree is because, locals could always use other public transport instead of cars, such as buses or bicycles, and in this way they could protect the environment without polluting it. Furthermore, even if the institutions would want to make a change by raising the taxes for car usage, people would still pay without having second thoughts and finding other solutions. For example, in the capital city of my country, the government implemented a new technique, because of the high number of accidents and traffic congestion, by adding high taxes to enter the city, but people would still pay an extremely high amount of money, instead of trying other options.",
        "In conclusion, one of the biggest change in a country, would start by changing its citizens' way of thinking, and it is not always the government's fault, when something is not going right."
