        "Nowadays, there are two type beliefs about children\u2019s education and that is whether children should be encouraged for sense of competition or they should be taught to cooperate rather than compete. In my opinion, both of them has advantages and disadvantages today and it is going to be explained in this essay.",
        "On one hand, competition is essential in our times because of a dramatic rise in the population. In crowded societies\u2019 education system, competition or competing children are used to filter which one is good or bad. For example, in my country there is an exam to decide for people that which university they can go. There has been lots of complaining about that competition education system. However, in such crowded environments, there is no other way to choose which one is accomplished or which one is failed. In other words, universities wants to chose the best ones for their foundations so the examination based on competitor is the only way to do that.",
        "On the other hand, some unique societies have an example of an educational system about teaching children to cooperate and live like co-operated societies. For instance, in Finland, there is no competition exams and teachers do not teach children to compete. They just teach them how to learn and how to develop their selves. I believe that is the most civilized way to learn and live. Their population property, location Specialty and economic characteristics give that opportunity. However, other ordinary and average countries do not have that potential.",
        "In conclusion, people think goods and bads both ways of educational properties which are competitive and co-operative. I think children should be taught to co-operate and do things together. But they should also learn to compete if their environment properties force them to do it. In other words, if they do not have another chance."
