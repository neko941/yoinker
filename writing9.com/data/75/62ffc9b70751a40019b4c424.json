        "Light festival is back this summer in Toronto from May 12th to 15th. It is a 4-day event where artists from all over the world are showcasing their talent in various forms of light structures. During my visit to London last year, we discussed  this and I remember how amused you were and how badly you wanted to visit, in spite of no visa. Along with lights, there will be a lot of food and drinks for you to taste. On the last day of the festival , there will be a barbeque where folks can cook their own food. In fact, you love cooking and I am pretty sure that you would definitely enjoy this .",
        "Furthermore, after the festival, I planned a road trip to Alberta where you can see picturesque locations and magnificent fields throughout the trip. I would like you to meet my friends and they want to cook you traditional Canadian cuisine. We will make all arrangements as per your liking.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
