In the features of newspaper or media broadcastings, viewers actually see the daily utmost occurrences, great initiatives, or other attractive work, which are important and can allure the followers. Publishers get such topics and plots from the daily instances of humans, such as accident, innovation or significant political decisions. Thus, the press releases and media announcements are closely related to individuals. For instance, recently a brutal rape case is got viral via online which is not only a tale of the victim but also many of the woman of this world.",

If an individual is read the paper, magazines, or watch reporting focused channels regularly that person is likely to inculcate most information from them. Consequently, more data and experience will be stored in his memory and with the progress of time he will be more resourceful; this gathered knowledge will promote him to grasp opportunities.
