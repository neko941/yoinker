        "Planning of cities is an important factor affecting citizens' daily-life. Many cities around the globe chose to separate areas according to their function such as: shopping areas, working areas and living areas. While this way of city planning may end up creating calmer neighborhoods for the citizens, I would argue that disadvantages outweigh the advantages.",
        "One good rationale behind separating shops, offices and homes is to create more quiet and safe neighborhoods. If places that are flood by hordes on daily basis such as shopping malls, behemoth office skyscrapers, loud schools will be established away of accommodation facilities, neighborhoods will be purified from unnecessary visitors making them better place to live in.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that such policy may contain more harm than benefit for several reasons. Firstly, isolating shopping areas and workplaces may result in higher traffic congestion. Especially during the rush-hour, when everyone will have to commute to their jobs. Secondly, with no local shopping centers in the neighborhood, people may be forced to cut long distances for essential daily needs like grocery. Ultimately, the population imbalance between different areas of cities, and traffic congestions resonating from afore-mentioned reasons will be a source of air pollution. Thus, all these factors will deteriorate the quality of living in the cities embracing this policy.",
        "In conclusion, despite the acceptable aim to create nice and calm neighborhoods, I strongly believe that accumulating facilities of the same category in specific areas will cause more serious damages such: traffic congestion, inconvenience in reaching basic needs and environmental damages."
