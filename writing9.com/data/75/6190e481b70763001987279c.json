        "It is true that the number of persons who choose to rent their properties instead of buying them is significantly increasing in some nations . Although I think that this tendency can have some obvious negative consequences, I believe that the advantages of renting a home outweigh the disadvantages .",
        "On the one hand , it is often argued that renting a house can bring some adverse results . Firstly, if someone chooses to rent a property , it will be sure his home but it won't be  his asset .Secondly, The lessees will have not the possibility to make changes or decorations to their apartments without the landlord's approval which can at any moment evict the lessees and put the house up for sale to make a profit  if real estate values increase .",
        "On the other hand , in spite of these arguments , renting a property has several obvious advantages .The strongest reason is the convenience ,flexibility and freedom which renting a house is  brought . For example ,  this approach remains the best decision for persons who travel frequently for work , it is easy to move out especially if they have a month-to-month lease . In addition , this approach can be  cheaper than buying a property , because the lessee is not obligated to pay the bill of repairs and maintenance and then they economize more  money .",
        "In conclusion , although that  the rent of a home can bound people of the freedom of decorating  them and having an asset , I believe that it is a positive tendency and help individuals to economize more money and have the freedom to move out easily .",
        "In conclusion ,"
