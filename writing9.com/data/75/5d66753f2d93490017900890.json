To get a sense of how the sound travels from your apartment to mine, I would invite you to sit in my living room while someone is playing.",
        "Unfortunately, I find it very difficult to work on my schoolwork at home when you practice. I need to read and write papers during the day, but this is very hard to do when you are playing.   When you practice early in the morning, it is impossible for me to get enough sleep.",
        "You may be aware that technically, if I made a complaint to the landlord, you would have to find a way to decrease the noise level coming from your apartment.  I do not wish to involve the landlord if we can avoid it. Perhaps we could agree on a time of day when you will practice?  With this arrangement, I could find an alternative place to study while you play.",
