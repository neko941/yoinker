        "During the interview, the human resource manager explained that the company quarters will not be available to new recruits as it was undergoing renovation which is expected to last for about three months. Since I do not reside in this city, I was caught unawares and immediately commenced a search for a convenient place to reside with the help of some housing agents. However, this proved to be a long search, as the only space available will not be vacant until next weekend, about 5 days after I am due to resume.",
