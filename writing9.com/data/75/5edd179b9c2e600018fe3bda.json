        "Nowadays, it can be heard that a man has a genius. Indeed, a very important question arises here. Is it really a talent? Or it is only the hard work that person has done. Most of the people think that one must be talented to have great accomplishments in a field like art and sport. Meanwhile, others see that  anyone can be a successful sportsman or an artist if good training is provided from an early age.",
        "Basically, a gift is a very significant success factor. The natural capability is the core idea behind the creativity. For example, Messi, who is one of the best football players has got a natural talent. Even though his physical characteristics are not perfect for a football player, his gift has put him to be a good  athlete. In addition, some street artists can draw magnificent images without a serious kind of training or education. Hence, expertise helps people to be good in things that they have never trained to do.",
        "on the other hand, sophisticated and strong preparation can make fantastic artist or sports person. According to a recent study, 50% of amazing basketball players have started from an early age. That shows how training and preparation might build a better player with no talent. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo the famous football player has too many achievements in contrast with Ronaldo the Brazilian. However,  Ronaldo the phenomena have a much better knack than Cristiano Ronaldo. Thus, expertise only cannot determine the level of human success.",
        "To conclude, I believe that kids may be prepared to become wonderful sportsman and painter. Talent is the key to be an artist or a sports person. However, talent is not a guarantee of success. Furthermore, Some people, which have no talent can be more successful that people with a genius. Therefore, it can be clearly seen, that talent is important, but it is not everything about for the progress."
