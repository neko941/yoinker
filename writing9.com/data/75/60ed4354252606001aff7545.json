        "Media and technology have already eliminated the geographical distance between the tourist and the destination, which leads the culture to spread to a convenient level. Therefore, some people would rather consume time to study the history, lifestyle and weather of another country by various virtual portals, however, there is an opposite opinion suggesting that learning culture should be achieved by getting onto the road. In my own view, I think travelling to another country is the best way to obtain a cultural experience.",
        "Firstly, learning culture requires an individual's response to the existing facts and long-lived customs in the certain background, hence, to be into the local circumstance is to commence to feel the culture. Otherwise, the cultural knowledge could only be a line of words displayed on the page or screen. For example, the comments on the flavour and taste of local delicacies could be made after the one has enjoyed it already. That is to say, immersing in culture is much more direct than reading a tour book or surfing on a tourism website.",
        "Secondly, the accuracy of the cultural content written on a book or uploaded on the Internet should be doubted because the misunderstanding of cultural activities or events happened frequently. Moreover, those contents which have not been evidenced would likely mislead the expectation of the tour planner. For example, the local transport information would change for a period of time.",
        "Due to the limitation of the modern high-intensive daily routine, the majority of people is not able to allocate their time for studying a typical culture by travelling. For instance, in today's society, workloads and pressure have drained the energy of an individual who has devoted whole attention to enhance the quality of life standard. In this case, learning a different culture from multiple resources could be possibly the feasible approach to reach.",
        "In conclusion, culture is more than the knowledge and facts which were posted on social media or have been explained by varied content providers. I strongly believe that starting a journey would be best for involving in culture by oneself."
