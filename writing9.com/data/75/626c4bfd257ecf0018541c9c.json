        "There has been an ongoing debate about making sports facilities available to people to improve public health. Some believe that this is the way to improve the health of people while others feel it has less effect on public health. In this essay, we will discuss both these views and look into my personal opinion about the topic. I feel the issue is multi-faceted with a number of factors such as good eating and sleeping habits and is not a simple directly proportional relationship.",
        "It is true that having access to a sports facility motivates many people to engage in sports activities. This is especially true for children and youngsters. It will give them an opportunity to socialize as well as participate in an activity that is interesting to them. Physical fitness is a by-product of this situation. The best part is that  people get to work out without going through the monotony or boredom of having to do regular exercise.",
        "However, most fit people are not the ones who specifically live close to any sports facility. In fact, there is no statistically significant correlation between the presence of sports facilities and the physical well-being of people living in neighbourhoods that have great tennis courts or swimming pools. I personally know many people especially older adults who prefer lighter exercises such as brisk walking or yoga as opposed to a high-intensity workout that requires going to a special facility. Some people simply get their daily dose of exercise from an evening walk or playing badminton in their backyard.",
        "In my opinion, good health is a result of  multiple  factors such as a clean diet, sufficient amount of sleep, healthy thinking patterns, good interpersonal relationships and maintaining an active lifestyle. Staying physically active is only one part that contributes to general health.",
        "Thus to conclude, while it is good to have sports facilities made available for people, it is not a prerequisite to good health. There are a number of other ways in which people can stay healthy if they wish."
