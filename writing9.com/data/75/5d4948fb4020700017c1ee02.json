        "I am SuryaTeja. I have recently been to your hotel the \"4 Point\" for a meeting organized by Tech213 last week, that is on June 15th. The event was a huge success and all the services provided by your hotel were excellent. After returning home, I realized that I have left few papers back in the party hall where the event was organized.",
