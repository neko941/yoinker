        "I hope that you and your family are doing great. Well, I am so excited to tell you that my wife and I are visiting Italy during the upcoming holidays! Yes, only the 2 of us, it happens to be our 10 years wedding anniversary, and I want it to be a romantic and memorable getaway. So, we will be keeping the kids at their grandparent\u2019s place for 2 weeks.",
        "I\u2019ll arrive at Rome International airport on 5 February at 5:55 am, we will surely be exhausted so we will head up to the hotel for a quick nap before initiating our activities. I am planning to stay in Rome for 5 days, so we have enough time to visit The Trevi fountains, the Colosseum, the Vatican, and to do some luxury shopping! Wife orders!",
        "Afterwards, we will get the train to Florence, spending 3 days with Maya, as honeymooners. I heard there is a great restaurant overlooking the river, with picturesque scenery, tasty food, and soothing music. Our final destination will be Milan, where you have to accommodate us for 5 days, whether you like it or not! Yet, I have nothing in mind, so I will keep it up to you to suggest the sightseeing to visit.",
        "It has been ages since we met each other, so I am really looking forward to seeing you and catching up on the good old times.",
        "See you very soon,",
