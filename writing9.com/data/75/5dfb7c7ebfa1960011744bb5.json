        "Nowadays, the issue of bringing up children to become a successful citizen has become important. As we are living in a competitive world, some people argue that offspring should be taught how to compete while others believe that they should be taught to cooperate. In my opinion, both these virtu are more essential for them to become a useful civilian.",
        "The first and foremost is that competitions motivate children to enhance their performance. Giving rewards to students for their achievement encourage them to make more efforts to defeat other competitors. In this way, juveniles are more likely to prepare well for other competitions including university education and employment.",
        "For instance, a recent survey conducted by London university has shown that there is a strong competition for university entrance exams as well as to get opportunity for better jobs. Secondly, when youngsters start any business, they have to compete with another businessman to succeed in life. Undoubtedly, successful person is useful adult in society.",
        "To justify my further views, there are many fields where cooperation is required. Juveniles can be taught this virtue in many activities like sports or any other game. For instance, when they have to  play team sports  such as cricket, hockey, football and so on then they  have to cooperate with their team members. Finally, when teachers give team work  to students then they also can be taught how to  manage and cooperate with each other.",
        "To put it in a nutshell, today's era is highly competitive. So both of the virtue is crucial for human being to become an ideal and useful citizen in the society as well as country."
