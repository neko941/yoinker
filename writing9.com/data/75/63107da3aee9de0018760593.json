        "In our neighbourhood,we never had a sponsor to support our children who lived in this area.So,with your offer children can play together in their leisure time.Moreover,this idea can help children who are suffering from health problems.",
        "I have been living in the area,since I was young,and have never seen a concert,so you cannot imagine how much this will affect our spirits to improve our mental health.Therefore,not only, you can earn money from the concert, but also you can extend your business on other aspects of the job.",
        "However, I would prefer to donate to a sports team owing to prevent wasting money.I believe,this choice is the best way for children who are willing to do physical activities.",
