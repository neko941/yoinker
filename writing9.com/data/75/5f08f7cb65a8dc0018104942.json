        "It's noticeable that excessive consumption of convenience food such as burger, pizza, French fries or soft drink could result in many health problems. To solve this problem, some countries proposed to increase the tax for these kinds of food. However, personally, I think this solution may not solve the problem completely, even possibly cause some negative effects on consumers.",
        "Imposing a higher tax on junk food could be ineffective in preventing consumers, especially who have high income, from eating this kind of food because they put convenience on a higher priority than health in today's busy life. While, lower-income families will have to shoulder the burdens of junk food enhancement because organic or fresh foods have a pretty high price and consume much time for cooking. As a result, they must find other kinds of food which are also convenient, quickly prepared but lower price. That means, quality of food they consume will reduce and consumers may suffer from more serious diseases. Additionally, because of convenience food tax increment, some food manufactures might find other ways to reduce budgets for producing processed foods like using low-quality ingredients and consumer will suffer from the consequences of this.",
        "Instead of increasing taxes for unhealthy foods, investing to improve the quality of fast food and make healthy food more affordable and convenient might be the better solution for governments. For fast food, it will be healthier for consumers if harmful ingredients are removed from food processing. Spending more money on developing modern machines, which make healthy food processing quicker and cost less, could enlarge consumption of organic foods. Besides, the government should promote education for citizens to have healthy lifestyles as well as awareness of consequences of eating junk food or microwaveable foods frequently.",
        "In conclusion, to reduce unhealthy foodstuff consumption, promote a healthy lifestyle and cultivate meal quality as well as food processing manufactures are better solutions than junk food tax increment."
