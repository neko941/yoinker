        "It is often argued that family has an enormous impact on children's life and development, whilst others believe that other factors such as friends, tv, music etc. As far as I am concerned, I vehemently agree with the first notion and this essay will discuss both points of view based on my personal opinions that can be given below.",
        "First of all, one of the first reasons why family becomes a greater influence on their offspring is because kids are more likely surrounded by their families every day and spent most of their time with them. This would mean that the parents are often taught their offspring about discipline, morality, manner, and the difference between right and wrong in their life. For example, the survey that has done by the researcher showed that a child who is living with his family is more successful compared to other children who are not living with their families.",
        "On the other hand, other aspects such as friends, tv and music also affected young adult's life and development. Friends, for instance, children who go to  school are having a lot of  friends. This would mean that they are also prone to be affected by their friends because they always play around or study together with them. On the contrary, no matter the things that affected them to become successful, nothing can bit the things which they have learned from their families.",
        "To sum it up, other influence factors besides family indeed give an impact on an adolescent's life and development. However, I strongly believe that family has the primary contribution for kids in the future."
