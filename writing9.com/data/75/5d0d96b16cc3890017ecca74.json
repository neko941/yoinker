        "In fact, the world encounters many challenges that seem serious nowadays. The most significant problems are related to the environment surrounding us which impact our lives accordingly. Some argue that technology is the best way to solve these problems, but I believe that establishing rules and policies are among the effective solutions.",
        "Technological advancements enable the researchers to invent novel approaches in order to find solutions for global issues like pollution and climate change. These developments have led to the production of several environmentally-friendly energy sources that could be safely used instead of traditional ones. Recently, many countries, for example, go towards utilizing these sources such as wind and solar energy which can significantly decrease the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that result from factories and cars' engine and then protect the environment from their harmful consequences. As a result, continuous improvements in technology will assist in maintaining our environment in a proper condition.",
        "In addition to technology, imposing strict policies can considerably support the resolution of numerous global environmental issues. For instance, effective implementation of sanctions on individuals, institutions, and plants that transgress those regulations will enhance stopping further dangerous impacts on the environment. United States and many other European countries have adopted this trend lately. For this reason, countries should cooperate and encourage each other to establish active rules for our environment protection.",
        "In conclusion, preserving the environment should be our main concern in the coming days. Although technological inventions are beneficial, practical regulations and policies have critical influence on solving a lot of ecological problems we all face these days."
