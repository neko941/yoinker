        "My name is Jane and my employee ID is 432267. I am writing this letter to draw your attention to the issue with a desktop that I am being faced at the office. There was a problem with screen resolution and UPS. These have occurred since last month and I already told the team leader many times, still no progress on it.",
        "Let me explain the complications thoroughly. Firstly, when I switch on the system, the screen goes blank for some time, afterward, it got fluctuate and some thin black lines appear on it. Moreover, after a couple of minutes, the screen gets back into the original position. By this, most of the time gets wasted and also causes a delay in delivering the work. Secondly, when the electricity goes off, the computer suddenly shuts down because the attached UPS is not working. So, the work which I was doing at that time, get lost. Consequently, this is putting a bad impact on my work and performance.",
        "It would be great if you address the above-said issues as soon as possible so that I can deliver my work on time. I suggest you to kindly, replace the defected parts of the computer. I shall be very thankful to you.",
        "I look forward to your prompt response.",
