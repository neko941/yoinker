        "Some public believe that releasing some stress in life can be eliminated by going to clubs and societies. This essay will discuss the reason why societies argue the abovementioned and province examples to support my ideas.",
        "To begin with, it can be doubted that the pressure from socialities is the main reason why people join the clubs. When worker desires to release the stress in their leisure time with their sympathised activities such as going to a tennis or football club to move some tension. Furthermore, they might also argue that exercise might be helped them to clear their negative emotions such as depression, worries, and sleeplessness; researchers indicate that the rapid movement activities might boost their energy to be more productive and desires to finish their workload.",
        "Furthermore, it can be argued that association might be linked to social contraction; the events such as local communities can be expanding their society to be larger webbing. For example, when universities require to construct a new building they might be asking for the alumni groups to  sponsorship to their university or support them by financial donation. Furthermore, they also use their group in such as recommendation, such as a graduated student who applies in a big company, they might be easily accepted to the position that they applied for due to their senior connection or this business might be received some suggestion letter from their comrade.",
        "In my ,opinion is the reason why people join clubs and communities because they are trying to reduce some tension due to their social force. Moreover, they also argue that this event can help them to build up social linking to expand their contract in the future in terms of applying for jobs or supporters in any case."
