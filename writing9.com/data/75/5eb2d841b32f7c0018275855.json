        "There is no doubt that the role of advanced treatments plays a significant role in day-to-day lifestyle. This is why most of citizens are expecting to live longer. However, I think that some of the challenges are outperforming opportunities of the medical development and in this essay, I will highlight both the views with pertinent examples.",
        "One merit is that modern science with a combination technology is saving a growing number of people so that the economy can run and prosper as smoothly as possible. That is to say, many people are acting as the most important vehicles of the society and it is barely possible to survive if they die for the absence of medical care. To give an illustrative example, if Barack Obama would have lost his life right after the election for less developed hospitals and medicines, the whole country had faced another election and another president. Furthermore, older residents can disseminate their experience and expertise for the grace of medical progress which newcomers might not have learned easily.",
        "On the other hand, the world is getting more populated than ever, and still a very less number of countries have limited birth controls. This is indeed unfortunate because a Government has a minimum amount of resources and this is impossible to meet everyone's necessities with that. For instance, urban cities face at least three times more traffic on roads than 1950's because of the increased population. As a result, countries, such as Japan and Taiwan are valuing elder communities less in order to serve the younger ones in society.",
        "In conclusion, I opine that health and wellbeing would remain as a priority in our lives and advanced medical services might pose a threat in the future without any initiative. While doctors and nurses save a lot of important dying patients every day to not to disrupt our economy, regulations and policies around having babies need to be imposed like China."
