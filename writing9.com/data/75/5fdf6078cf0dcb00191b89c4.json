        "Choice of one's dress is a highly debatable issue, this issue is common in social media. People are different and they like to wear different types of clothes depending on occasion, place and climate. However, in this essay, I am discussing, the given statement and put forth my opinion below.",
        "One of the major reasons is to show the standard of life. The majority of people try to showcase their financial status through the dress they wear. For instance, some people spend money to buy clothes from famous designers, from which it is clear to others that they have higher income and are able to afford. Secondly, personal choice. There are people who wear clothes depending on climate and place. Moreover, people tend to wear clothes depending on comfort, which is mostly seen.",
        "After pondering upon the reasons, in my opinion, wearing fashionable clothes is a bad idea because in most cases traditional values are lost. The majority of kids do not know what is a traditional dress and the importance of it. In addition, some dresses were preferred for some festivals which have some meanings. Another reason is social media impacts on personal life. Since technology has grown widely people update their details and this can lead to controversies. For instance, a large number of people update about there day-to-day life in social media. Moreover,  some people comment badly and affect their personal life.",
        "I summarise that wearing a dress is one's personal choice but never people should lose the value of tradition and spend a large amount to buy these."
