        "Climate change has become an urgent issue for modern societies as its impacts have materialized in many different ways around the world. While some individuals and organizations spend countless resources in hope of reversing its damages, others retire to learning to live with the Earth as it is. Although both sides have their reasons, I personally think we should try our best to undo the assaults we have done to our planet.",
        "Accepting global warming is most appealing when it comes to economic practices. In other words, it would be more convenient and profitable to put aside environmental concerns when doing business. Poor communities are oftentimes unable to afford environment-friendly methods of production. Moreover, without having to install green technologies, companies can reduce costs and reap more profits, which will contribute to GDP. Another seeming benefit of adapting to climate change is the continuation of comforts we enjoy every day. This is because most daily activities are harmful to the Earth in one way or another. With the intention to co-exist with global warming, there would be no need to avoid using plastic utensils or biking to work instead of driving.",
        "Nonetheless, we should join hands in an attempt to prevent and reverse as many environmental issues as possible, since adopting such defeated attitudes is selfish to both ourselves and our children. The environment has significant influences on our wellbeing, and hurting the Earth means hurting ourselves. This has been vividly demonstrated by the Covid-19 pandemic: the virus is able to spread due to our poaching of wild primates and overpopulation. As a result, many countries took detrimental blows to their economies and the life quality of their people. Additionally, if excessive exploitations of natural resources do not stop, future generations will shoulder catastrophic consequences of starvation and ill health when there is no longer enough foodstuff and plants from which medications can be synthesized. There are, therefore, strong arguments supporting a fight against global warming.",
        "In conclusion, regardless of the short-term benefits of ignoring the progression of climate change, its present and future consequences are undeniable. Instead of passively living comfortable but polluting lifestyles, we should actively participate in conservation efforts happening around the world to be responsible to our communities and our children."
