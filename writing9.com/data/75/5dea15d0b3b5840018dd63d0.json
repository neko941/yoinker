        "I am travelling to Indonesia for a week from 12th to 17th of December for the annual offsite program at our office, along with my family. The tickets are already booked and my kids are looking forward to the trip. I really wish that my trip has not overlapped with Lissie\u2019s Birthday. I hope you understand my situation. Please covey my birthday wishes to Lissie in advance.",
        "However, I would like to make it up for my absence on Lissie\u2019s birthday. What do you think about a family get together at my place on the weekend after my trip, that is, on 20th December? It will be a great opportunity for our kids to get along and my wife will also be excited to see you and Rebecca after so long. Please discuss with Rebecca on my invitation and convey my apologies for not making it to the party.",
