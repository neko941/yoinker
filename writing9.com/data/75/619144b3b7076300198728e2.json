        "Nowadays, quick meal consumption is rising day by day and it is known that it can lead to serious health problems. Thus, it is argued by some people that junk food should be forbidden. I partly disagree with this opinion because banning fast food would lead to other consequences and it is not the only solution.",
        "On the one hand, it is true that people who are addicted to food that contain a lot of fat are more prone to obesity and heart disease which affect their health a lot. The reason why is because fast food is high in sugar, salt, and saturated fats. Otherwise, snacks could lead to addiction, especially to children. Fast food is highly popular with children because of its taste and convenience. It can be seen that children would reject other healthy food and prefer having an unhealthy diet instead, which leads to an imbalance in the diet.",
        "On the other hand, I do believe that junk food should not be banned completely. First, if fast-food restaurants and chains have to close, the employees there would have to give up their jobs , which eventually leads to job loss. Second, it is difficult to find such affordable, convenient, and tasty dishes as fast food. So instead of forbidding convenience food, there are many ways to solve this problem. For instance, minimizing fast-food commercials and raising awareness of people about the harm of fast food can be alternative solutions to the issue.",
        "By way of conclusion, I reckon that fast food should not be banned. Instead, we should avoid its consumption on a large scale. In my opinion, humans should rather focus on the benefits of consuming healthy meals and promote them on a large scale"
