        "\"Health is Wealth \". Nowadays, because of the fast-moving lifestyle, humans are spoiling their health. Therefore, a set of folks believe that doing exercise alone can keep people healthy, at the same time few others opine this  by telling that diet is more important than exercise. However,  in my opinion, both exercise and diet  are equally important to stay healthy. This essay will examine the topic in detail with relevant examples in the following paragraphs.",
        "To begin with,being active is the only way to avoid many lifestyle disorders like Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus.  Therefore, it is very important to do regular exercises. At the same time, it is also necessary to follow the diet according to the health status. For example, research conducted by Rajiv Gandhi University Of Health Sciences, India, proved that the patients with increased blood glucose levels had shown good control of blood sugar when they started with the diabetes diet and an hour of exercise per day.",
        "To continue with,  eating healthy foods can help persons to live a happy life, but it is necessary to do some physical activities also for initiating digestion process. For example, obese people are not allowed to eat according to their wish, without doing physical exercises. Moreover, nowadays people are eating more fatty foods. Even though they eat in minimal quantity also it is needed to do any activity for eliminating unwanted cholesterol from the body.",
        "Finally, because of fast-moving life people are eating unaccountably and not doing activities also. So, in my opinion, it is important to give special attention to both exercise and diet."
