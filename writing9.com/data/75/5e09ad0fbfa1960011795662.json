        "Modern electronic gadgets and their influence on letter writing skills is debatable. Some people claim that due to increased use of mobiles and computers few people have retained the habit of letter writing, however, others feel this art of letter writing will disappear completely. I partly agree with this statement because official communication will be by  the conventional method of writing letters, however personal communication has been completely replaced by a short chat on the mobiles or computers.",
        "Firstly, today people are busy and everyone possesses mobiles. So, it is far more convenient for them to chat on mobiles frequently, rather than letter writing. Because letters will take longer time to reach the concerned destination. Moreover, personal messages to the love ones are very short, unlike the long inland letters of olden days. For instance, my mother still cherishes the letters written by my father during the time of their marriage. In addition, mobiles can be conveniently  accessed by children as well for communication. Therefore, these traditional personal letter writing has not only become outdated, but very soon it might disappear completely. Similar to the telegram which was recently shut down permanently all over the world.",
        "Secondly, official communication will always remain in black and white. Because these official letters are an evidence of communication. Although, it can be communicated via mobiles or computers it will still, be in the format of official letters. So, the traditional format of these business letters has not changed over time. In addition, these letters are posted to the respective places after fixing stamps and if it is urgent speed post can be opted, where the letters reach within 24 hours. For example, I receive my house rental payment confirmation by an official letter from my owner every month.",
        "In conclusion, although personal communication by letter writing might get disappeared, the official communication will always be in the form of traditional writing of letters."
