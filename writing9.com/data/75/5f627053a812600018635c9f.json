        "The computer has changed our lives in different aspects such as work, education, entertainment and many more. Some people claim that many children play computers games a lot of the time and  less participates in outdoor sports. Well,it has affected their development both negatively and positively. Let us discuss the topic in detail with some relevant examples.",
        "To begin with, modern technology has provided various electronic gadgets such as computers, mobile phones, tablets. Children keep themselves entertained all the times by playing computer games, online video games with other players whether they are sitting in the same country or another.",
        "However, adolescents are getting addicted to computer games. To cite an example, a recent survey showed that 78% of kids have been involved in PUBG game in India. Most of the games are online and children just love to surf the internet . Sometimes, they become very depressed and get aggressive for normal things in their life.",
        "Moreover, it has a negative impact on a kid's development because they participate less in outdoor games. Physical games keep them more healthy and fit, more alive. For instance, every year schools arrange 3 sports matches at a state level in Pakistan for the development of children. Also, electronic devices release ultrasound rays which are harmful to eyes and body. It has been seen that many children start wearing glasses at an early age and then doctors advise them to wear them for the rest of their lives.",
        "To put it in a nutshell, excessive use of computers can cause more harmful effects on kids.  The schools and their parents should supervise their offspring's and guide them to play outdoor games for their physical and mental good health."
