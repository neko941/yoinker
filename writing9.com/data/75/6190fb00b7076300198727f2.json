        "Opportunities to work abroad are more today than in the past, many people are grasping these chances. They are working in foreign with their family. In my opinion, I considered that working aborad with a family has both positives and negatives impact on individually.",
        "There are several reasons why many people prefer doing a job in other countries with a family. The first and foremost important thing is that the family relationship can not be weakened by long -distance. For example, in a survey has conducted in the UK, there are 70% of people may have divorced every year because of long-distance relationships. Furthermore, persons can not feel loneliness and homesickness when they are with their family. Hence, taking a family with them can have more benefits.",
        "Another point to consider working with a family abroad is also beneficial for the children. The children who are young ages need love and care from both parents. For instance, In India, more parents leave their children with their grandparents when they are going to work foreign, children are deprived of their parent's love. Moreover, childhood is a crucial phase of life and comes only once. If children will not get one parent love it may have a considerable impact on their psyche. Therefore, working in other countries with a family can provide complete love and care to the children.",
        "On the other hand, there are some problems working abroad with family. Firstly, people have to share a house with others because living abroad in a personal house is more expensive. In addition, it is easy for a single person to share an apartment with someone, but a family needs a proper house. secondly, parents feel culture shock and therefore they can not help their children.",
        "In the conclusion, making a decision to live with a family abroad can lead to more advantages, but people should not neglect some drawbacks of living with the family while working abroad"
