        "In the old centuries, when technology hasn\u2019t appeared, people usually use books as the best source to attain knowledge. But now, with sophisticated computers, smartphones and especially the birth of the internet, these have now become a potent tool in helping people assimilate knowledge. This trend has its pros and cons, but I believed that the advantages it produced do outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "To begin with, it is undeniable that using internet as a knowledge retaining tool certainly has negative aspects. The fact that if people being too reliant on the internet, it will lose the major value of traditional books. For instance, many people might have a thought that books are excessive and useless as internet can provide instantly every piece of information that we need without spending time searching for it like we have to do when using books. Moreover, there are many different kinds of websites on the internet that we can access to, but some of them are not reliable enough as they proved wrong or not verified the information, result in the misunderstanding of the readers.",
        "However, compared with the aforementioned minus points, I argue that the benefits of this trend would prove to be more important. Keeping knowledge on the internet means that we can abandon the fears of losing books while some books containing people\u2019s crucial knowledge. For example, if a student needs to interpret a story in the book that has been lost due to his or her carelessness, student can easily search for it on the internet. Not only that, people can find information instantly if they are in hurry to preparing their speech or exam. Furthermore, with many unique, vibrant and interesting videos, movies or pictures, internet could be a great supporter in helping people to remember or understand fully essential knowledge.",
        "In conclusion, there are many drawbacks in storing knowledge on the internet instead of books. However, it seems to me that its benefits would be more important regarding."
