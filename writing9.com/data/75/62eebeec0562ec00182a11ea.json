        "Dear Customer service manager,",
        "I am writing this letter to inform you about my missing cabin backpack which I forgot on the A887 plane at Vancouver airport on 27th July. Furthermore, It was a quiet rush on the plane when we arrived at the airport and somehow I forgot while coming out of the plane.",
        "As you heard, my bag is a VIP brand new one which I bought a few days ago during the holiday season at our place. It also has a name tag along with additional two handles which would help to pull the bag despite the rush at any place. In addition, you can see my name on the bag which I wrote with a pen to identify the bag in rush place too.",
        "I was more worried about inside items. I kept them in two different folders. In the right side folder, we have mesmerized and breathtaking sceneries which I decided to present as a gift to my friend. Whereas, in the left side  folder, I kept my career certificates which I obtain from a reputed institution.",
        "Last but not least, I also kept my home keys and now I am thinking about how to go a home with empty hands.",
        "I look forward to hearing a quick update on this letter and I hope it will come soon.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
        "Lakshmi."
