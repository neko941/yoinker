        "Most of the persons who are office goers get very less or no workout neither during weekdays nor on weekends due to which they suffer from unhealthiness. This is generally because they do not get time for themselves  or their fitness regime and it can be resolved by the addition of physical activities in regular life. In due course, I will discuss the problem with a relevant example and discuss the solution for the same.",
        "To begin with,the most predominant reason why working-class population ends up doing no or minimal exercise due to time crunch.This is because they might work more than the office hours which makes them mentally tired and exhausted. Furthermore,in order to relax , they use their leisure time for doing house chores or indoor entertainment purposes during weekends. For instance, According to  research done by London university, it was found that in India most of the working-class people are doing sedentary jobs and have no time for extracurricular due to less work-life balance.",
        "The most effective solution to mitigate the issue should be the inclusion of physical activity in day to day life. Due to busy schedules,it is very tough to stay committed to one\u2019s fitness schedule so few activities can be included in our routine life. For example, walking has been proven to be the most effective workout if done on a regular basis. Moreover, Individuals who face time crunch due to their jobs or any other reason can try to commute by walking. In addition, they should minimize the usage of lifts by using stairs.",
        "To conclude, humans might get very less exercise due to time constraint or poor work-life balance, However, this issue can be resolved by simply adding physical activities in our day to day jobs."
