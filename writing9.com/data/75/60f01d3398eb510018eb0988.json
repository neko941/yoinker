Some like-minded people foster this thinking that A group of people are of the view that consumers prefer buying domestically. However, l will discuss  people nowadays tend to buy international items problem before reaching  the conclusion.",
        "To begin with, the obvious reason for buying international products is the quality of products and value for money. International brands such as Adidas, Nike & Mango keeps consumer comfort and requirements as their top priority while making an article. As compared to local items, an international product would cost a little more but considering quality it would be worth spending the money. For example , I bought Nike shoes online , their quality was extraordinary and their comfort was exactly how I wished; whereas even if I spend on a domestic product It would not sustain even 3 months.",
        "On the other hand, one more obvious reason for international brand purchasing is the maintenance of social status. People nowadays are status conscious and feel pride in wearing  international items rather than  ones local. The mindset of wearing top-notch products does not let people purchase domestic items. For example, At a  party if am wearing a local brand that is obviously not as famous as an international one I would be considered probably poor or outdated.",
