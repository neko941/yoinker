        "In many countries across the globe, the crime rate has been skyrocketing.Consequently, crimes are becoming more fatal for people. In the following paragraphs, I intend to outline the causes of increasing the crimes and suggest a few ways to mitigate this issue.",
        "On the one hand, Owing to the ever- increasing population, people are facing fierce competition in finding employment opportunities and as a result, more and more people are getting indulged in heinous activities such as drug dealing,bribes to earn their livelihood. Furthermore, education is important and is essential for the growth of an individual. However, many parents are not able to afford to pay for their children's schooling due to which they are not responsible towards their society and become more violent.",
        "On the other hand, there are different possible ways to curb this issue.Firstly, The government should control the population growth rate and which in turn, will give more chances of employment opportunities to the millennial citizens. The people will be able to earn their living and will lead a happy life which will end up into fewer crime rate.Secondly, likewise food and shelter, education should be a  basic right and free for all so that each and everyone gets an equal opportunity to succeed. Therefore, citizens will be more responsible and less violent.",
        "For instance, from the age of 13 to 17, Children are immature to take decision about their life so education is important in guiding them and helping them to choose their career for their future.",
        "To sum up, there are several issues because of which felony percentage has been increasing, such as high unemployment rate and lack of education. So, the government should be responsible and take crucial steps for eradicating this problem by giving more employment opportunities to the citizens and making education free for everyone."
