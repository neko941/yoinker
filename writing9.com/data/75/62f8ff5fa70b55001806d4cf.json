        "The availability of the same goods in all corners of the world has increased the similarity between countries, and this event would have some consequences. In my opinion, the aforementioned development has its own merits and drawbacks that I am going to elucidate comprehensively.",
        "To begin with, it is apt to mention that this development brings people of the world a chance to become familiar with the unique products of other nations, and a chance for the local society to make more money through exporting their special commodities like spices to other continents. For example, Iran has the best saffron and caviar in the world and globalization brought Iranians a remarkable opportunity to earn lots of money by finding their own position in the global food market; the more familiarity and popularity with the aforementioned materials among foreigners would form, the more demand for them and more income for the local people would be.",
        "Concerning disadvantages, the major destructing effect of creating similarity between different nations is cultural fading in that the people of undeveloped countries who have old and rich traditions try to mimic the lifestyle of modern ones. For instance, we are witness to that in India have young girls a strong tendency to wear more fashioned western clothes instead of wearing Saree which is their own traditional clothing code. Moreover, such actions could diminish the tourist attractions for tourists who travel to observe the unique and rich cultures and traditions of various regions\u2019 indigenous inhabitants.",
        "To sum up, concerning the increase of similarity among countries that are the origin of various races and cultures and the impacts of this phenomenon I contemplate that it has both positive and negative consequences as I mentioned in the above paragraphs."
