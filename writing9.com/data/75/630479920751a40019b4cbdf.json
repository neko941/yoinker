        "Nowadays, youth want to live in developed zones for the reason that there are no available jobs and perspectives in the countryside, as a result, youth are leaving all old people alone. That can be a cause of  several problems,",
        "First of all, for the reason that young people are moving to cities, it can be a cause for overpopulation in towns, on the other hand, as a result of only old humans in the countryside, soon enough, the land won't be alive. For instance, in one village near the city were young people who decided to leave that place for living in the metropolis, on the contrary, there is enough youth in that metropolis, consequently, will be overpopulation in the city and soon, as there only old-aged left, the village won't exist.",
        "Since it is a very influential problem, there must be solutions for it. In my point of view, the government should develop the countryside. In different words, these places should become more similar to towns. For example, humans are leaving because of the small number of working places and possibilities that metropolises can give, besides, if there will be these possibilities then there will not need to move. The government should develop all places equally, then there won't be a problem.",
        "In the conclusion, there is an important issue that can cause other problems, nevertheless, there is always a solution if human beings want to solve it. In this particular issue, the government should start thinking about actions."
