        "It is thought by many people that women are more peaceful than men as they have a  loving character naturally, and this leads them to be less aggressive compared to men. I totally believe that women are softer and more easygoing. However, I also think that not all men are violent and aggressive.",
        "It is generally believed that the character traits of women are different than men. In other words, women tend to be understanding and gentle, and this can be seen in every aspect of their lives, such as treating their offspring and family or their employees, whereas men naturally born with some traits which causes them to be more protective and suspicious. For example, men tend to see strangers as a threat to their home and family, so they might act arrogant and aggressive to compete with them. While, females show more sympathetic and friendly behaviour towards strangers.",
        "It is true that males are more violent and protective, however this behaviour should not be automatically attributed to all men. Genes and environmental factors have a huge impact on each gender's behaviour. In the society, polite and easygoing men tend to be seen as soft and weak, and they are not considered as \"real men\". Consequently, this\u00a0peer pressure leads those men to stop caring others around them and to start to behave rudely. For example, in some underdeveloped countries, arrogant actions of male show that he has power. Thus, perhaps there are more polite men than aggressive, but they are worried to show their kindness to the world as these characteristics are often seen as weak in some societies.",
        "In conclusion, females are softer and more gentle than males. However, this does not mean that all men born with aggressiveness."
