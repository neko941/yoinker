        "With new technology available few higher education institutes are moving their education on web networking so students can learn from there instead of Physical class. In this essay I would like to talk about if it is a good development or not with relevant example or experience.",
        "Firstly, education is a very important part of our life. One can achieve great success with knowledge and it also open many doors of opportunity. As there is saying, \" knowledge is the Key to success\". Education which takes place in class is having a different impact on students then having learned over online. In class learning have a personal interaction with Professor and it is more convenient to communicate and clear  any doubts. As well as one gets a clear understanding of the topic because of one to one communication if there are any doubts. For example, students who are learning into a business they get a clear pitcher as a teacher can explain topic brief and clear any doubt due to easy communication.",
        "Secondly, university which conduct education by online, I would not say they are not good, but at some rate they are really good for the students who want to do a short course and stay very far from their educational institutions. It is easy for also those who work and study, which help them to earn extra cash and don't need to worry about missing a class. For instance, person who work and stay very far from the college can easily attend their class  within their comfort zone.For instance, person who stay and work really far from their education school it is more convenient for them to attend online it help them to make extra cash from work as well as they save travel expenses.",
        "To summarize, Both online and in class has their pros and cons, It is help full who is unable to travel to their universities, but as from my personal experience of both side's I believe online class are not a positive development. Online education does have benefits such as it can be done in a comfort zone and we can get recording of class which is helpful to review back, but it does not have much clarity of the subject and also there can be issues of connection in online class which make it more difficult to understand in online and most important it reduce the interest of learning due to which it reduce focus."
