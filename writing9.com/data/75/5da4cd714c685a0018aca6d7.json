        "Presently, it is becoming an obligation for everyone to own a mobile phone. Some believe that children also should be included in this trend while others disapprovee this idea. This essay discusses both views of the argument and then I will give my own perspective.",
        "On one hand, there are people who argue that children owning a mobile phone allow their parents to keep track of themselves thus giving them some peace of mind. This, undoubtedly acts as a safety gear and consequently enable them both the parents and the kids to have some degree of freedom. For example, there are some applications on mobile phones which makes it easy to follow a dear one without the other one feeling intrude. Furthermore, it can assist the child in any case of emergency as the child can phone their guardians or any person of authority such as police, firemen or doctors independently. Thus showing the benefits of such gadgets.",
        "On the other hand, having a mobile phone at such a tender age can have various negative impacts. Firstly, the child can develop an addiction, which could eventually lead to a sedentary lifestyle. For instance, a study from Harvard university in 2017, showed that children who are exposed to long hours of mobile phones, are prone to emotional, physical and psychological trauma. In addition, they become exposed to other risks such as pornography and online pedophiles. This is because of their naive nature and inability to understand the danger behind the scene and, as a consequence may become victims in a short span of time.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that both sides of this contentious arguments have their merits. On balance, however, I tend to believe that children should not be given a mobile phone since the risks are far more greater than its benefits, and damages can last for a lifetime. Instead, parents should find more effective ways of keeping track of their kids and educate them in case of urgencies."
