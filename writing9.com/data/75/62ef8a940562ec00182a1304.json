        "There are two primary ways for people to obtain new knowledge in an unfamiliar field, books and experience. Some people agree with the opinion that books act like the most crucial role in gaining new knowledge. However, from my point of view, I prefer to say that learning from experience outweighs books as learning from experience is fast and solid.",
        "Books are, of course, the most important sources of knowledge; they contain contents related to a specific field with detailed descriptions and abstract formulas. Therefore, people who advocate reading books to learn new things often say book provides the most convenient way to get to know cutting-edge knowledge. For instance, when a kid wants to study physical rules, they don't need to set up an experimental environment to test the basic physical principles. But, I think learning new things merely from the book is not very fast, and usually, people can't assimilate the hard core of the knowledge.",
        "On the contrary, I prefer to study new things via experience, especially with experts in the related field. So, knowledge gained from experience is usually more practical than from books. That is since the experience is condensed from a lot of failures and is likely more applicable to solve some real problems. For example, as a software engineer, solving the bugs I encountered is not mentioned in any book. Therefore, to settle these challenging problems, I have to ask for help from my colleagues because they might suffer the same type of issues before.",
        "In conclusion, learning from books is still a primary method for people, especially young people in school. However, after graduating, gaining new knowledge from regular work or a mentor's advice is the right choice for people who want to study faster and more practical."
