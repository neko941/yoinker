        "Increase in tourism has resulted in English becoming one of the most important languages in the world. Therefore, many believe that as a consequence, English will be the only globally spoken language. Although this will ease communication and lead to economic growth, there are also drawbacks to be taken into account.",
        "On the one hand, there are a number of benefits of having one common language in the world. Firstly, it will make communication easy, which will result in an increase in  global participation. In other words, not only nations but also people will be able to express themselves easily without being misunderstood. Secondly, a common language will ensure economic growth, as it will reduce every barrier and bring various countries together. For instance, one-fourth of the world's local craftsmen are unable to sell their products globally due to language barrier.",
        "On the other hand, one problem that common language brings is the loss of identity of various cultures, because language is a significant part of any society and any change in it will lead to loss of individual culture. Another possible issue will be a fall in tourism. To illustrate, people travel to India in n order to experience its rich language and culture, so if there is a common global language then people will be less attracted to visit India. Furthermore, it will majorly affect the countries whose economy is dependent on tourism.",
        "In conclusion, while one language can lead to an increase in communication between nations, it can also result in a loss of cultural diversity."
