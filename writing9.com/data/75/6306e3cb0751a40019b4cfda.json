        "Nowadays, the majority of people argue about information, they believe that online systems are better than attending university classes. However, both have a strong motive, but I strongly believe that college learning is far better than online schooling, I want to delineate both points in this following essay.",
        "First of all, the college learning process has several merits, for example, in college, you can interact with your crew is face-to-face communication is very important in most expertise. Secondly, if you want to be a master in any particular subject you would be able to discuss your research with your peers and your organization, which you never had in an online program. Thirdly, the class lectures are very beneficial in degree development. Which is not available in online culture. Throughout the lecture, cadres pay extra attention to their recruitment, they could be able to read their student\u2019s minds and their facial expressions. It is possible for personnel to interact with their admission whether they have clear concepts or not which is impossible in online series. Looking from all these perspectives, online learning is unquestionable.",
        "On the other hand, however, online schooling had a weaker prospect but has some advantages as well. For example, those enlisted who are working full time and unable to attend university for any particular genuine reasons, so, online classes have a good platform for those populaces. Furthermore, as we know due to the pandemic authorities do not allow students to attend classes, in this sense online way played a vital role in the cultural industry.",
        "In addition, I agree that both perspectives are right but online study cannot replace campus learning because it makes you confident and successful in the future, which you cannot achieve in online study."
