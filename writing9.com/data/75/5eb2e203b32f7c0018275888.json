        "The importance and popularity of exercise by walking have deteriorated over the past few years. Experts throughout developing and developed worlds have debated what are the actual reasons behind this and what might be the effective solutions. Both sides of this issue will be examined in the following essay.",
        "On the one hand, there are three crucial causes that impede the walking activity. The most important one is safety. An extensive study by renowned university has illustrated that most people are afraid of being robbed during walking, especially evening time. As a result, the physical fitness tends to decrease. Consistent this line of thinking is no work-life-balance. Due to the fact that the competitive environment forces people to work harder, hence, they have not been able to manage time well and no time for walking. Last but not least, the weather is another uncontrollable factor. For instance, summer season in Thailand may be too hot to go out.",
        "On the other hand, although there are ample underlying reasons of reduced rate in exercise, it multifold solutions cannot be denied. First and the foremost, government should play a significant role by lifting the level of security or severity of sentence. The best example for this is that Canada has a high standard of security, thus, Canadian is able to stroll even during the night. Another point that should be taken into consideration is that social activities must be created such as making an incentive by made a running marathon every month.",
        "To conclude from the aforementioned arguments, I strongly believe that laziness might be the main difficulty of fitting. However, I would recommend that the government should raise awareness of being healthy and support other methods of fitness, such as, providing indoor sport facility."
