        "It is argued that in recent times the way men and women communicate with each other has been changed due to technology. This harms the relationships because it decreases face to face interaction among people and they do not have time for their loved ones.",
        "Most of the people these days interact with each other through digital media that reduces face-to-face interactions. In other words, people are addicted to social media to an extent that they have forgotten their families and living relations. Therefore, they are more interested in virtual relationships rather than talking to people in person. For example, research done by the Times of India in 2014 showed that there has been a 30 percent decrease in face-to-face interaction among people in the last 10 years after the use of advanced technology.",
        "People do not spend time with their families because they are always busy with their online friends and spend most of their time on mobile phones and on social networking sites. This is to say that, in earlier times people used to spend their leisure time with families and are involved in family gatherings, but now this trend has been changed with the invention of technology. Therefore, it has become a negative development because relationships between members of families are getting weaker. For instance, according to a recent survey by the New York Times 70 percent of the people spend their free time on phones and the rest 30 percent are those who spend the time with families.",
        "In conclusion, technology has affected the relationships in a negative way this is because it reduces interaction between people in person and they do not spend sufficient amount of time with their families."
