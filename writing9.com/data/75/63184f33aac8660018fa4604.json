        "A wedding is a very important event in everyone's life . People planned their wedding with great excitement .they anxiously waited for years to enjoy the special day with their dear and near ones . It is very common to see people throw huge weddings some even do destination weddings which caused a lot of money . The assertion seems pretty controversial across the globe. Without any doubt, Society is divided into two groups as per distinct mindsets of different peoples. A fair number of people think it's ok to spend money because one gets married once in their life while others think people can use that money in a different way to secure their future . Whether to agree or not it's a tough-provoking question. As far as I see it's more justified to agree with the second statement that people should spend their money more wisely . In upcoming paragraphs, I will not only shed light on both sides but also elaborate on my point of view.",
        "To embark, if we have a deep look we will certainly able to find a good number of reasons why people spend a lot of money on weddings. The first and foremost , reason behind this is they want to make it memorable and cherish them for the rest of their life . Secondly , some people like to match their status . They like to show off .",
        "Furthermore, people like to enjoy their most important day with family and friends. For instance, in India people usually have big weddings because they have big families . They can't avoid relatives. They invited each and every relative and friend to their marriage .as a result, it become a huge function which cost a lot of money .",
        "On the paradoxical side, a school of individuals think that it is far better to spend  money wisely .the first and foremost reason behind this is some people take loans from banks to hold a wedding .as a result it's going to be hard to live their life with debts. Secondly, people work so hard to meet two ends meal so it's very important to spend money wisely . They can use it on more valuable things  like life insurance, health insurance, car insurance, children's school expenses and many more . For instance, a survey showed that  in India many people prefer to have a small wedding and later with the savings they buy a house or car which is more important .",
        "In conclusion, there are two types of people in our society who thought differently . But as far as I can see it is more justified to agree with the latter statement because the wedding is a one-day event but savings can help us lifetime"
