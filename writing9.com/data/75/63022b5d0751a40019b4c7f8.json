        "In this modern era, smartphones  have become a major source of entertainment, and communication Over the last few decades there is a massive improvement in this technology. Due to its wide availability, and affordability children are using this and spending a lot of time playing games and using social media. This phenomenon has both positive and negative aspects. On my account, it has more negativity and this is will be discussed in this essay .",
        "First of all, the massive development of daily communication and globalization helps us to use smartphones  and other gadgets in the workplace and education sectors but few children get addicted to the overuse of smartphones. For instance, children love to play a lot of games, especially video games, and social media also. Modern smartphones  provide a lot of online games. For this reason, children also slowly getting addicted to mobile phones. On the other hand, some children use social media as a form of entertainment at an early age, which later on creates  anxiety  and depression. Perhaps parents can play a certain important role. For instance, they can restrict the handling of smartphones by their offspring. Not only that but parents should devote some time to playing with their hair too.",
        "It is true that  certain incident has a area of positive or negative sides. It's can create a serious impact on the development of a child's brain. For example, a child when using any gadgets sees himself as a visual character for a  longer period. Consequently, the child could face some difficulties while adjusting to the real world. It might be possible that they lack communication skills in future. On the other hand, there are many apps that help in the growth of the brain, sometimes in critical thinking and creativity. In addition, smartphones can be used for educational purposes also.",
        "To conclude, all modern gadgets have both advantages and disadvantages. It is our responsibility to make the right privilege of it. It is also the responsibility of both parents and children to make the right use of every gadget."
