        "The controversial topic concerning learning English at school never fails to attract public attention. Many local languages could disappear because some people believe that studying English at school is more substantial than studying local languages. In my opinion, in today's world, it is crucial for everyone to learn English, but without neglecting their mother tongue. I also believe that we should ensure the survival of local languages by devoting more resources to them.",
        "Firstly, learning English at schools is a must. Because English is an international language that provides whoever speaks it  better access to the world. For instance, people who speak English have more opportunities than those who cannot speak English. That's why English should be taught to children at schools. For this reason, some people think that learning English is more substantial than learning local languages.",
        "Secondly, although learning English at schools is important, it doesn't mean that local languages should be neglected at schools. So, we should all work together to help the survival of local languages at schools. Because local languages help children present themselves to the world and to show their authentic culture. Furthermore, local languages are linked to their local economy so much that the local economy would not survive without them. For this reason, proper actions have to be taken to prevent local languages from dying. For example, Devoting resources to the locality such as highly qualified teachers as well as the continuous practice of the language at schools could help preserve it.",
        "In conclusion, it is commonly thought that learning local languages at schools is less important than learning the English language. Although English is important in today's world, local languages cannot be neglected at schools and they should be preserved by devoting resources like highly qualified teachers and by the continuous practice of the languages."
