        "The power of communication is what makes humans unique, and since we had mastered it, mankind began to develop rapidly. That is why I believe that we need to have a universal dialect such as English, however, we should maintain regional tongues as well, because they are the sheer culture of elder communities with the knowledge that would be lost if they are not taught to other people.",
        "First of all, in the world of international business English is the most spoken jargon. It is an easy idiom to learn and all paramount corporations if not owned by English speaker nations,  do trade with them. Furthermore, a great share of the world know the tongue and makes tourism around the world more enjoyable. Therefore, I agree with the  importance of learning English at school because it will be useful later in life.",
        "Likewise, regional dialects are necessary as well, because with them lives ancient knowledge. For example, indigenous tribes learned about the healing properties of plants and not knowing how to communicate with them we lose a great number of different medicines. Thus, local authorities ought to create tertiary courses with lost dialects, and people who wanted to be specialized in the field could  ensure that these ancient cultures do not die.",
        "In conclusion, language is the most important asset humankind have. In other words, we should not only have a universally spoken idiom but still keep alive all ancient ones. This way we would develop faster and history and culture would not die."
