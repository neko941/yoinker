        "Let me explain what happened. I was currently occupied with a design project. The customer is very troublesome and it is already the eighteenth version and she is still not satisfied. My boss keeps putting pressure on me as he wants to issue the bill within this month. Therefore I worked till around 4am on Friday night and overslept. When I woke up it was already 2 o'clock in the afternoon and everybody would have gone already even had I come out immediately.",
        "Next time when I work late, I would send a message to my girlfriend and tell her to ring me up. Setting an alarm clock using the smartphone doesn't work, as the sound is not loud enough. Please accept my sincere apology and I promise there won't be a next time.",
