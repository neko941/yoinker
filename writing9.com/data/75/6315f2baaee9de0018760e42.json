        "Education plays a great role in people's lives and also helps in the country's development.  Some individuals think that parents are a great influence on the academic development of kids, while others think that teachers are more impact on children's academic growth. In my opinion, I think that both parents and instructors are an equal impact on a child's education development. I will explain my reasons for it in the following paragraphs.",
        "To commence with, parents are the first instructors for a kid, this is because guardians give their offsprings all social manners like sitting habit and how to respect elders including teachers. Also, home becomes the initial school for children where they learn all skills before going to  school.  For example, a new baby is born and then starts to talk and walk, these all are impacted by their parent's guidance and observation. Furthermore, those tasks have come from school is the parent's duty to solve all the tasks which are assigned by the teachers. If parents will make friendly behaviour with their children then they can learn all academic skills very effectively.",
        "The role of a teacher is to play a great role in children's lives, this is because from a teacher students can enhance their all weak points. For example, If any student is weak in a particular academic subject then the instructors have the ability to understand their children's problems and work on them. Also, teachers give children proper lessons according to the academic criteria and as a result, students work harder on their weakest points. Moreover, instructors can judge individuals' capability and IQ level by assigning tasks and building their problem-solving skills.",
        "To conclude, I think that both guardians and teachers play an important role in individuals' life and impact equally on children's academic development."
