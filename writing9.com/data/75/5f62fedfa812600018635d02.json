        "Hello,",
        "I am resident of Lake County and have been living there since my birth in 1985. I am writing this letter in regards to the new shopping centre being built in our locality.",
        "I came to know about the shopping centre through the local newspaper and I have mixed feeling about it. On one hand, having a mall in our locality could solve many of our concerns ranging from good shopping options to lack of food plazas. As I read, they also plan to infuse a multiplex into the mall, which would be a great addition to our locality. On the flip side, I am concerned about the delivery and the timeline as the Raheja Builders seems to be relatively new. It wouldn't be astonishing if new developers abandon a project due to lack of funds.",
        "If we aren't considering other developers for the project, it would be helpful to know, what are the plans of Raheja Builders to guarantee the completion of the project. Concurrently, it would be reassuring to the residents if they have any previous projects to show, as we also share the vision of a hopping centre in our county.",
