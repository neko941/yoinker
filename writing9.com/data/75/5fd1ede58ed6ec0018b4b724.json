        "It is generally believed that the majority of people are spending their maximum portion of adulthood at work. That\u2019s why  one of the necessary elements for a cheerful life is  satisfaction at the workplace. This essay will discuss the main contributing factors to job satisfaction. This essay will also explain the expectation of it for every employee.",
        "First of all, it is generally believed that an individual\u2019s passion for work and high incentives are the major factors for the satisfaction of the worker. In other words, an emerging interest for specific work that provides maximum salary is the key factor for enjoying  life through work. The fact that is concluded by  recent research at Tribhuwan University illustrates that the person whose work is connected with hobby or interest and has the highest salary is supposed to be the most satisfied as well as happiest in his/her life. For this reason, every individual should choose their job according to the work that they really love to do in his/her daily life.",
        "Secondly, the expectation to be satisfied is extremely low for the middle-class worker. This is to say that people tend to perform their work not because they like but due to the family pressure or just for their living. Let\u2019s use a developing country as an example. Those are the country where the majority of the youngster is forced to leave their academic study in the middle and are forced to work for earning.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, it is clear that a certain desire and enough pay is the most important while working on a daily basis. In addition, these elements aren\u2019t much realistic in many countries due to other various reasons. Therefore I strongly believe that  the government should vehemently deem at this situation for the welfare of the citizens."
