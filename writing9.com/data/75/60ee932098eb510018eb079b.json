        "Some parents are of the opinion that toddlers should be placed in the care of relatives, while others prefer to entrust their children to daycare centres. Although both options have their advantages and disadvantages, I highly recommend that preschool kids be sent to kindergartens to optimize their early cognitive development.",
        "Being cared for by families give children a greater chance of building healthy future relationships. According to the renowned child psychologist Mary Ainsworth, the quality of adult attachments mirrors those formed during early childhood. As a result, a child who is cared for by devoted relatives is more likely to enjoy secure attachments during both infancy and adulthood. Nevertheless, there is a remarkable loophole when children are raised this way. To initiate and sustain early cognitive growth, scientific strategies are required which non-professionals might not be aware of. That is to say, having families as carers may satisfy kids' emotional needs, but is lacking when the training of their intelligence is concerned.",
        "On the other hand, childcare centres provide a superior alternative, in my opinion. This option has been reported as being adverse for preschoolers' emotional health; with dozens of children on hand, the staff is unlikely to give adequate attention to any individual. Nonetheless, this concern has been addressed by the sophisticated training of nursery teachers in a wide range of related fields such as education and psychology, which has significantly improved childcare services in recent decades. Moreover, attending kindergarten will better assist toddlers when it comes to cognitive growth. Psychological research has shown that to stimulate the ability to encode a memory of the infant's brain, constant challenges have to be presented to the children. Such activities have been embedded in the programs of many daycare centres, especially those in developed countries. For instance, from videos on the Internet featuring Norwegian childcare services, nursery teachers can be seen to effectively engage their students in fun competitions, word-building games, and storytelling. These are all evidence-based methods to maximize neuronal growth in children. Regarding this aspect, non-expert family members are comparatively inadequate.",
        "In conclusion, there are indeed emotional benefits in having relatives as child carers, but modern-day highly trained nursery staffs are capable of bringing about the same mental security. Hence, although some parents may think that their children should be taken care of by families, I advise that toddlers be entrusted to childcare centres to peak their early brain development, being given that emotional health is no longer an issue."
