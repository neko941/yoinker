        "In today's world, there are many ways to contact consists of speaking and writing are the classic types of communication. Many people think that  speaking is more important than the writing process. This essay will argue that speaking is more dominant than writing.",
        "Writing is one of the methods to communicate with others. In the past, writing letters is more common when no telephones or internet were exits. In addition, people who live in an area where is far apart such as someone who lives in  Europe wants to communicate with their parents who live in Asia. So, writing in the paper sent by mail is an important conversation at that time. However, the text in the letter needs a way to transport to the recipient and the messages on the paper only show the dry conversation so the receiver cannot notice the sender's voice or facial expression. If the recipient wants to reply back, it needs to wait until it arrives back to the sender,",
        "On the other hand, speaking is faster and more powerful than writing due to making a phone call, waiting until the person who wants to talk with picks up the call; the conversations happen immediately. For instance, speaking does not need to waste time to write a letter and send it via mail-post, now there is a technology that can help us to solve this problem by communicating easily. Moreover, when we talk to others we can notice their facial's expression and make eye's contact.",
        "This essay argued why written communication is less powerful than spoken communication. In my opinion, writing is wasting time especially in the era of fully efficient technology to communicate with others by only making a call immediately to have sudden speaking words."
