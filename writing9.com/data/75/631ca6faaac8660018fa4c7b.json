        "Some say going to university can be too burdensome for deprived communities or individuals from remote areas. Therefore, academic institutions should not make it difficult for them. Although I agree with the statement, I believe that universities should still do a thorough review and regulations in order for them to pursue a college degree.",
        "On the one hand, fundamentally, all individuals should have the same opportunity to get exposed to formal education regardless of their status and conditions. For example, formal academics such as universities can help those who are struggling by providing them scholarships for excellent students, or student loans or accommodation closer to the varsity for those who live in rural areas so that it will lessen their burden on transportation. In addition, if the pupils are motivated by the aid of the academy, it is more likely they can give the best contribution to the school and society after graduation.",
        "On the other hand, although it is a great idea to make it especially easy for indigent groups or Countryside communities, it is best believes to not give it too lightly to all the people just because they are poor or live in rural areas because it can cause some disadvantages too such as, some of them might spoil the freedom that they are given like does not take their study seriously just because it\u2019s easy for them to get in. Therefore, the university should do a thorough review and regulations for the students who are willing to dedicate their studies. Since might not all of them want to pursue formal education.",
        "To conclude, I admittedly agree for academic institutions should lessen their burden to pursue a study. However, universities still have to give restrictive requirements so that only highly motivated students can get the full advantage of the school\u2019s aid."
