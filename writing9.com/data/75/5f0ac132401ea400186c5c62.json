        "Some people argue that the government of a nation is not responsible for public health, and it is a personal responsibility. I believe it is a duty of both. It is necessary that a person should look after its health; however, the government has a role to play in the well-being of the nation.",
        "At the onset, a healthy lifestyle is a personal duty, as nothing will work until you work. In a day-to-day life, there are many easy ways to keep yourself healthy and higher authorities have no control over it. Firstly, eat healthy home cooked food and avoid fast food. Secondly, fitness experts suggest at least thirty minutes of exercise a day can keep many chronic illnesses away. Lastly, have a required amount of shuteye at night. In the aforementioned suggestions governance has no role, they can only underpin it, but it is a personal responsibility. For example, a gym in all parks has been constructed by the Indian health ministry; nevertheless , it will not help until people use it on their own.",
        "At the opposite end of the spectrum, the health sector of a nation requires its ruler's attention. When it comes to serious threats, expert supervision of doctors is most sought after. Invariably, having ill-managed public health sector, then citizens may not be healthy, no mater how hard they try. Moreover, moderate earners are unable to afford the fees of doctors and they die. It is a government responsibility that they provide fellow citizens with the high-class hospitals and qualified doctors at a nominal fee. To illustrate, in India many dispensaries are established merely for the weaker sections of Indian society.",
        "In conclusion, although leading a healthy lifestyle is an individual's personal duty, a government should provide citizens with a basic and affordable health care system. when it comes to fitness, the individual's responsibility and the government efforts go hand in hand."
