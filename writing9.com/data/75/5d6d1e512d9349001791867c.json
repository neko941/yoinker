        "Nowadays, western societies are confronting a problem of growing number of overweight children, which is 20% higher than the last ten years. A Lifestyle which western people accustomed, of which is mostly involved of doing indoor activity and eating junk food, might be considered a reason for this problem.",
        "Today, most kids prefer to have junk food like pizza and burgers rather than other healthy food. These junk foods contain extra fats and more eating causes children to gain unnecessary weights. Extra weight does not help in any way. It leads to various problems like: high blood pressure, heart related problems, and feeling tiredness mostly after doing small work. For example, health report data shows that today, most of the people suffer from cardio related issue, which is directly due to extra fats accumulate in the pipe that goes from cardio vessel.",
        "Second, the most considerable reason is children are not participating in doing more physical activity today, In contrast to, kids of past decades. As these days teenagers, mostly like to play indoor computer or video games instead of going outside and play something which requires your body to move. While playing sports like football and baseball  helps to make our bodies in continuing motion, which in turn provide continuing healthy blood circulation in the body and also burns extra fats. Continuous eating junk food  without exercising only helps to gather waste particles in the body, which in after some times  become the consequence of severe health pertaining problems.",
        "To deal with this problem, it is important to promote body movement activities like: gaming, dancing etc. Although it is not easy to remove these unhealthy or junk foods immediately from societies, there should be a chart, graph which shows about how much consumption should have to avoid serious illness.",
        "In conclusion, the main reason for obesity on children these days, especially in western people is due to eating without proper exercise, which cannot be seen in the case of rural areas because there are availability of these fancy oily foods, computers and video games are much less and also they embroiled themselves in doing more physical work. So In order to to plummet the percentage of this increasing overweight, children should improve their lifestyles by eating healthy food with at least some exercise."
