        "Last week, I bought a chimney from shop which was initially working fine. However, after one day, while it was running some strange noises came out and it stopped working. In shock and awe, I immediately called your helpdesk and the salesperson told me that the situation will be rectified within 72 hours; the complaint receipt number is enclosed with the letter. A week\u2019s time has already passed without resolving the matter.",
        "As a manager, I want you to either replace the item as it under warranty period or refund the whole amount. I am even ready to drive to your respective shop in order to hand you the chimney.",
