        "In the past, there were prefect close band between neighbours, but nowadays we even do not know our neighbours. There are several reasons why citizens have reduced their relations with neighbours and some ways which seems would be effective.",
        "Four main elements are to blame for why people have less contact with neighbours. Firstly, we spend a lot of time at work and are in association with our co-workers instead of neighbours. Secondly, nowadays, people have varied hobbies such as watching a movie, playing video games, etc. therefore they spend much more time inside their homes. Finally, because of modern forms of communication we have a large circle of friends and we are in touch with them through social media. In consequence, these days people have a busy lifestyle, thus they have less time to be in touch with their neighbours.",
        "In order to have better contact between neighbours, there are some ways. First of all, when a new neighbour comes to our area, we can bring a small gift for them and introduce ourselves. Next, social places such as parks, gyms, and playgrounds for children in our neighbourhood can help us to strike up a friendship with our neighbours. Lastly, to have a regular meeting with neighbours in order to discuss about problems and other things in neighbourhoods which can affect them.",
        "In conclusion, modern lifestyles caused people do not have a working relationship with their neighbours. Although these ways likely will not be able to make neighbours as important as they were in the past, they will probably help us to develop our relationship with them."
