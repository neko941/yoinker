        "It is often thought that environmental issues can be tackled by raising the price of petroleum products for cars as well as vehicles. In my opinion, I utterly disagree with this standpoint because factories and industries are the principal culprits of environmental pollution, and such a policy will be unfair to the masses.",
        "To begin with, it is noteworthy that most manufacturing companies are  responsible for the discharge of toxic gases to the environment which are not environmentally friendly. In other words, these factories consume an enormous amount of fossil fuels more than automobiles. They give out carbon dioxide as a by-product which causes depletion of the ozone layer and subsequent global warming. Unless the government restrict the activities of industries, environmental problems will remain a formidable challenge. To illustrate, a recent study conducted in Harvard University revealed that factories are responsible for 70% of the air pollution in the western world. Thus, vehicles and automobiles pose a lesser threat to the environment compared to manufacturing industries.",
        "In addition, making petrol more expensive will be unfair because such a policy on impoverished citizens. Moreover, since the affluent will be able to afford purchasing petrol, the price notwithstanding, it is not an effective policy. In Nigeria, for instance, when the price of petroleum products escalated as a result of economic recession in 2017, a vast majority of people were still able to maintain their vehicles and buy petrol. Thus, raising the cost of petrol is not the most appropriate remedy to this problem.",
        "In conclusion, I wholeheartedly disagree with the idea of increasing the cost of petrol and petroleum products because factories are the major cause of environmental pollution, and such a policy is ineffective and unfair. Hence, it is recommended that the government invest heavily in clean renewable energy which is ecologically friendly."
