        "I hope you are doing well, I am writing this letter to let you that I just bought a new big television in my living room on this black Friday. And I am trying to get rid off from my previous television. I think you probably take a look at it. If you would like to buy.",
        "Its an amazing led tv from Samsung. The screen size is 43 inches, good for your apartment. It is only 2 years old and still have 3 years extended warranty on it. Mint condition, no issue. However, I lost the original remote, but you can use it with your smartphone through an app that is free of cost.",
