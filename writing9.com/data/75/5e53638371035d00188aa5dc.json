        "It is a common fact that more people\u00a0are migrating\u00a0from developing nations to developed ones in order to seek for a better living environment for their children. Some people support that their decisions will benefit their children's growth; while, others believe that new living environments will bring drawbacks for their children. The essay will discuss the both views and presents my support to the former view.",
        "To begin with, moving to a rich\u00a0nation will provide a high quality of life\u00a0for children. Moreover, harmonious communities, better educational resources, clean living environment with close-zero\u00a0pollutions, and universal health care system\u00a0in rich countries will benefit in children's development as well. For example, Chinese immigrants in\u00a0Canada provide a safer environment for their children\u00a0to grow well there. At least, in the current moment, their children are living in a society without being threatened by corona viruses. Their children have much happier lives in schools without facing extremely heavy study tasks as those in China.",
        "On the other hand, some people believe that relocating to an unfamiliar nation will bring negative impacts on the young newcomers. They will\u00a0encounter with culture shocks, language barriers, different climates, lack of peers and social life\u00a0etc. In addition, an unfamiliar living environment also will have a detrimental impact on\u00a0their cognitive capacity. Finally, they may\u00a0suffer from psychological issues, such as depression or anxiety, due to\u00a0inadequate supports from their communities or their parents who are also facing the similar conditions as well.",
        "In conclusion, I personally opine that emigration to rich countries will benefit the younger generation due to a better living environment. However,\u00a0relocation\u00a0will create\u00a0challenges for children\u00a0due to above reasons. Therefore, in order to prevent the drawbacks,\u00a0parents should involve their children make the decision and start to prepare ahead, such as learning a new language, a new culture etc. before their movement"
