        "It was great to hear from you and I\u2019m really surprised that Diana has already turned to 8. It sounds as if she has grown so fast. I wish her a happy birthday and thank you for inviting me to this special occasion.",
        "I would love to be at Diana's birthday party but I\u2019m terribly sorry that I can not make it due to some deadlines at my office next week. The problem is that I\u2019ve been promoted to the assistant manager position a few months ago and the work pressure has skyrocketed since then. The office management has assured me that I will be given an assistant soon but until that happens, I will hardly have time to spend for me.",
        "Perhaps I can visit you sometime next summer when I hope I will stay with you for a couple of days. Please share some birthday photos on Facebook so that I get a glimpse of the celebration. I owe Diana a birthday gift.",
        "Anyway, I must finish today. So thanks once again for your kind invitation and I do hope that we can get together sometime in the summer.",
