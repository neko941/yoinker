        "In the present world, every country participating in space research. It has so many advantages as well as disadvantages. Some of these will be discussed in the below paragraphs.",
        "Firstly, space research is important to every country. In space research, we can find a lot of information, like weather conditions, soil, water levels in space and whether it is useful for human lives or not. If we can do research on these, it will be  very useful for humans.Because  In the world population is increasing day by day, and natural resources are decreasing on the earth, So It is tough to live on the earth. For instance, take some countries such as China,India etc., we compare those countries, the population is growing rapidly. If it continues in the future, it may be a big problem for human lifestyle, because we cannot provide natural resources, and we may not have the earth for a living. In this situation, we can see space is an alternative to living. It is the main advantage for humans.",
        "In addition, space research has a few disadvantages like it is too much cost for the research and  build the spacecraft. Even though, If the research is successful money is not a concern, but we cannot say always successful, because it depends on various conditions like bad weather,technical issues in spacecraft, etc.",
        "In conclusion, space research is important to every country and it has so many benefits for humans. At the same time if the research fails we can lose so much money. Space research is a big achievement for every country."
