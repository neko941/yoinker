        "There has been a controversy about the advantages and disadvantages of imported products. I think their merits outweigh their demerits, and my reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs.",
        "First, they can gratify the demands of the domestic market. It's expected that not all countries are self-reliant; due to some determinants of their territory, such as climate and latitude, they can't produce some particular products. At this point, importing goods from other countries can solve this problem to a large extent. Take Germany as an example. On account of its domestic climate, it's difficult to grow some fruit, like oranges and bananas. Therefore, to tackle this issue, Germany imports a sizeable portion of fruit from other countries, such as Spain and Italy.",
        "Second, lessening the domestic resource pressure. As mentioned in the last paragraph, not all countries have rich resources and are self-reliant. Take Japan as an example. It has been reported that Japan has to import 94.5% of natural gas from other countries annually. Hence, in order to fix this issue, they choose to import resources from other countries. For instance, oil is extremely popular in the international market. Oil-rich countries rely on it to stimulate their economy, and those oil-poor countries rely on that imported oil to alleviate the domestic oil crisis.",
        "On the other hand, importing goods has some problems. For instance, they infringe upon the domestic products' market. Take China as an example. There are numerous imported cars in China, such as BMW and Volkswagen, and they are becoming even more popular now. As a consequence, their proportion in the car market has increased dramatically, and the ratio of those domestic cars has shrunk considerably.",
        "In conclusion, I believe the benefits of importing products outstrip its problems."
