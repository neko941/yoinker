        "A good number of companies are offering their workers the option to work from home so that they will have much more flexible working hours at home. I, personally, believe that this trend has a positive development.",
        "To begin with, we are living in a world where everything is systematic and available online, especially thanks to technology. Moreover, there are huge numbers of software available in the markets and that can be used while telecommuting, such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Connect. Consequently, companies are taking a great initiative to allow their staff to work remotely, as a result, they will have more flexible time to manage their personal and professional life. For example, according to the recent survey revealed in the Khaleej Times last month, around 80% of employees' performance increased sharply after the employer allowed them to work remotely.",
        "Furthermore, the other benefit is that employees will save time and money while working from home. Nowadays, it has been noticed that traffic delays and frustrations can cause depression and mental health issues as individuals reach their workplaces after spending hours in the traffic, thus, people cannot give their 100% at work. On the other hand, telecommuters do not have to commute to the office as this could save their lots of money and, above all, time. For instance, a technology company in Dubai has posted a survey on Linkedin that 100% of employees have saved around 17% of their salary while telecommuting.",
        "To conclude, there are a huge number of benefits while working remotely as individuals will have enough time to manage their personal and professional life at the same time. However, it is the responsibility of individuals to stay committed and focused on office assignments."
