        "Education is the foremost right of humans.  Education plays a significant  role in the progress of the human race. Education  is the backbone of a nation . Education helps people to get knowledge,  make confident and make capable enough  to face the difficulties of the modern world.  One of the  most conspicuous trends of today's world is a colossal  upsurge in the number of people believing that history  is the most important subject than other school  subjects.  The assertion  seems pretty  controversial across the globe.  Without any doubt,  society  is divided  into two groups as per the distinct mindsets  of different folks. A fair amount  of people believe  history  is the most important  subject while others  claim science  and technology are more important.  Whether  to agree or not it's  a  tough-provoking question.  As far as I see it is more justified  to agree  with the statement  that science is a more important  subject  than history . In upcoming paragraphs,  I will not only shed light on  both sides but also elaborate  on my point of view.",
        "To embark,  if we have a deep look we can find  numerous reasons  why a fair community think history  is one of the most important subjects. The first and foremost  reason  behind this history  gives  us the opportunity  to connect to our roots . We get to know about  our culture and traditions.  Secondly,  we get to know about our nation's background.  For instance,  from history, we got to know about  how the kings ruled India . How India got independent from Britain in 1947 and many more . Additionally, historical subject  help to protect  our identity.",
        "On the paradoxical  side,  others claim that science  and technology are more important subjects to  study  . The first  and foremost  reason  behind  this is science  is an interesting  subject.  Pupils  can learn a plethora of new things related  to the environment and nature. Secondly,  they can learn practically.Science  provides us with labs for experiments . As a result,  we can be more productive  and experimental. Additionally, when we study science and technology great future waited for us . Students  from the science stream can get a plethora of job opportunities  with high-paid salaries. As nowadays  companies require employees with a good sense of technology. Last not  least, science  students  can have numerous  courses  to choose from after higher secondary  exams. For example, I'm a student in the science  stream and I have chosen BSc  to do in college.  I'm glad that I did that because of that now I'm willing to go abroad  to study physiotherapy  .",
        "In conclusion,  all subject  has their own Importance.  But I suppose it is more justified  to disagree  with the statement  that history is the most important  subject.  As far as I can see science  and technology  are more beneficial to study."
