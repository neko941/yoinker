        "Extreme sport  is one controversial topic that many people have argued over. Some think that the authorities should restrict all high-risk competitive games, while others believe that individual should be given the freedom to play any sport he or she wishes to. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss two points of view and conclude with my personal opinion.",
        "Some people are against extremely physical activity because they are hazardous and can put one life in danger or death. There is a very high possibility of injuries even with the safety precautions. For example, in 2018, during the traditional Portuguese bullfighting event, the animal took revenge on six bullfighters, causing seizures and head injury. Banning this kind of physical recreation will cause less harm to human beings.",
        "On the contrary, the opponents of the arguments believe that extreme sport is much needed for some people to release their stress because they want more challenging activities to help them build more confidence and motivation. Moreover, it is a great way to have fun and provide new experiences, and it helps others overcome fear and build physical and mental health.",
        "In general, sports are dangerous because of their very nature. They require us to push the limits of our bodies and reach new heights of physical existence. For instance, in non-extreme physical activities like tennis and badminton, a player's shoulders might also get injured due to muscle overuse. So, high-risk physical activity should not be prohibited because everyone has the right to do things that make them happy."
