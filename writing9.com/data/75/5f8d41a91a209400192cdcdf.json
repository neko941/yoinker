        "In the contemporary era, an interview holds an important role in deciding whether a candidate is suitable for a particular job or not. I strongly agree that an interview is a foremost method to deduce about an employee\u2019s communication skills, presence of mind, attitude and confidence. Hence, I will enlighten my views further in this essay.",
        "To begin with, one of the primary reasons for conducting an interview is determining good communication skills. For instance, a person could have an exorbitant experience and multiple qualifications but if he is not been able to express himself face to face, he would face rejection. Moreover, an interviewer also ascertains the presence of mind of an individual by giving him situational tasks to perform. For instance, in a call-centre job, one has to be attentive in order to answer queries of the clients instantly, to ensure that he does not lose his client. Thus, meeting in person is considered to be the finest way to choose the employees.",
        "Furthermore, an employer is very stringent on a person\u2019s attitude and level of confidence because it is prominent for its growth. For instance, an optimistic and self-controlled person gets along with his colleagues and managers quite easily because of the consistent behaviour. On the contrary, boasting off and giving a gloomy outlook would definitely turn down a person\u2019s character and one could face rejection. Therefore, it is always considered to be supreme by having one-on-one conversation, in order to pick out a suitable employee.",
        "In conclusion, although an employer could only depict the above-mentioned traits by means of conducting an interview, one should not forget the talent and qualifications of a knowledgeable person. In my opinion, interview is the finest method of deciding the future of an employee as well as of an employer."
