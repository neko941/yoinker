        "A good environment is admirable for everybody. Nowadays, the environment is getting polluted due to various reasons. Some communities believe that to decline the global environmental problems there should be a surge in the cost of fuels. I disagree with this matter because there will be a huge impact on society when the cost of fuels is raised. In this essay, I will discuss  this matter with relevant examples.",
        "On the one side, Environment is getting disturbed due to various human activities. It is the responsibility of humans to  nature. Some human activities are deforestation, plastic usage, etc are leading to global warming. For example, Nowadays, people are using vehicles which run on fuels like petrol and diesel. Due to these ,vehicles air pollution is occurring  which disturbs Nature.",
        "Nowadays, Every machine like transportation vehicles, Industrial equipment, etc is using fuels to produce the products. Due to this global problems are surged. Some people think that solution to this problem is to raise the costs of fuels. But this will lead to the destruction of the development of the nation. For instance, recently, some developing countries increased the costs of fuels but after some days there is a huge impact on the economy of that countries. People also face many problems when there is a rise in the cost of fuels because this will lead to an increase in the cost of products. So, Normal middle-class people cannot afford to pay for the basic things to live.",
        "To sum up, In my ,view there will be a great impact on society when there is a surge in the costs of fuels. It also impacts the economy of the country which will increase the price of fuel. Finally, I disagree with the given statement."
