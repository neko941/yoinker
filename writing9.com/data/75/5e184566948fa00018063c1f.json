        "I am writing this letter to inform you, about the problem I am facing with the bus servicing in my area over the last two weeks. The main problem is that, the bus is having engine problems with it which is causing enormous sound pollution, as well as air pollution from its exhaust in my area. Moreover, there are no technicians in the nearby area to repair it instantly.",

In other words, the elderly people are suffering the most because of this situation. In addition, there is no supervisor or concerned person to monitor the situation in our community.",
