        "Experts throughout both the developed and developing countries have predicted that, into the foreseeable future, a larger group of people across the world will go on a vacation in their own country rather than preferring to travel abroad. I strongly agree with this notion as the global situation has changed due to pandemic crisis that affected the factors such as  economy, health  care facilities, travel industry and auto-mobile industry. This essay, will discuss about the predictions and the reasons as to why people will prefer domestic travels based on Harvard Tourism Review research and Oxford University surveys to demonstrate the views.",
        "To begin with, the central reason for people preferring to be in the same country during the vacation period is of twofold. Firstly, the intention of improving the economy of their own country is increasing and secondly, the healthcare conditions in various countries cannot be assured due to lack of details available through authorized channels. Although the recent pandemic crisis is one typical example that increased the travel within the country, it is also predicted that global recession will decline the economic conditions further. Towards this, the cost of travel has increased heavily due to safety measures, and hence people want to reduce the expenses towards tickets and also want to contribute to their nation's economy by means of travelling to various provinces. In the same line of thinking, Harvard Tourism Review research published an article that more than 78% of the people are scared to travel due to the health factors that are unknown and also wanted to spend their money in other provinces, to learn about the attributes such as food habits, culture, tradition and heritage of the other provinces instead of knowing other countries people's lives, which is predicted to continue for a very long time.",
        "In addition to this, every country is currently focusing on improving their healthcare systems and nations are not encouraging people to travel abroad, given the fact that vaccines are not immediately available and other viruses are also emerging. Consistent with this thought process, Oxford University conducted an experiment through a survey across the developed and developing nation's policy makers about the possible bills that are going to be devised around healthcare and economy improvements. Further, it published an article based on the insights derived through the survey that illustrated that people will be encouraged to travel within the country with subsidised plans, tax reduction and assured heath care systems. Because of such flexibilities and as it offers personal benefits, people are expected to travel only in their own countries rather than preferring to travel to other countries.",
        "In conclusion, with the aforementioned views and examples, I strongly agree with the view that travelling in the same country on a holiday will continue for a very long time as the global situation recovery is not seen in the near future. This leads to further affirmation that more people will prefer to be in their own country and spend their time and money on leisure activities during holidays and vacation rather than taking enormous risks."
