        "It is true that peer pressure has become common among teenagers impacting their life in different ways. Though in general, it has both positives and negatives, in my opinion, the benefits of influence by peers are more than the drawbacks.",
        "Those that argue the disadvantages of having influenced by peers point to the possibility of bad habits that can be formed from peers. Young people can easily learn dangerous skills from the others in their circle. For example, if one smokes, it can easily affect the other friends, who were not used to this habit before. While there is always a chance of negative influence from peers, parents can influence their younger ones to choose their friends carefully to prevent them from getting into a trap of dangerous habits in their life.",
        "However, I would argue that there are more advantages of having a good friends circle. Firstly, young people can learn a variety of skills from the others in their group. For instance, communication and language skills are improved by exchanging ideas with a diverse set of peers. Though there is plenty of information available on the internet, it can be accessed faster with the help of fellow groups as they can guide and point to the appropriate information. Secondly, there is a clear advantage of competitive spirit developed between peers of the same age. They can pick up activities from each other to prove their abilities and improve their skills. For example, someone developing code to write a game can inspire others also to improve their coding skills by developing similar or different games.",
        "In conclusion, I argue that a healthy competitive spirit and an opportunity to learn from peers of the same age are more when young people are surrounded by the right set of people who can positively influence them. While I acknowledge that there are some negatives of getting into a net of bad influences, this can be solved by the guidance of parents."
