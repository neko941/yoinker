        "Social networking sites, used by people to be connected with their friends, families and get updated with daily news. In my opinion, I consider that social media brought people considerably closer and digitally connected whole world. Therefore, these social media apps bring tremendous benefits in human's life compared to any problem it might bring.",
        "Despite the drawbacks below, I believe that social media is extremely useful for human being. These days, on social media sites, It is exceedingly easy to keep in touch with friends and family, anywhere in the whole world. In other words, On networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and several other apps, people can reach instantly to anyone, based in any foreign country and can call and send messages, at a significant low cost of the internet data plan. For example, students opt admission in various colleges or universities, in different cities or abroad and in student life, it's immensely tough to cope up   with an unacquainted culture and places, therefore, it is essential for them to be connected with their loved ones at all the times. To call or text internationally through phone numbers can cost them an astronomical amount of money. However, audio or video calling and texting via social media, remarkably cost a negligible fee as it uses the internet data of mobile network plan that students can perfectly afford. This, ultimately give them huge mental support to adjust in a new environment. Moreover, people can easily make new friends and extend their social network for entertainment. For instance, people can send friend request to anyone through social media and get quickly mingle up with new people of several other backgrounds and culture. In addition to this, people can get updated with a vast number of daily news articles on social networking sites. To illustrate, on Facebook, people post local, national or world news events and others can freely comment or give their own views on those post so it is astonishing to well familiar with daily news of the nation or the other foreign country.",
        "Admittedly, there are some issues involving when people excessively use these social networking sites. One concern is that it could affect personal or social relationships of people. For an example, when people spend their large amount of free time on chatting with other people instead of face to face conversation with friends and family members then it would be problematic for their real relationships. But, it is absolutely depends on person to utterly understand the fruitful moderate use of social media. Furthermore, sometimes, people are involved in criminal activities, could post irrelevant or fake news that could pose a threat to national or international peace. To cite an example, few people of offending character, can post an atrocious article against any religious group or can give undignified comment on any news post that could create a situation of feud among various religious groups. Although, it is completely rare as there are strict laws and legislations against violation of world peace through social media.",
        "In conclusion, social media is potentially beneficial for people in terms of social connection with loved ones and new friends from all over the world and this clearly outweigh any disadvantages."
