        "Some hobbies are relatively easy, while others present more of a challenge. Personally, I believe that both types of hobby can be fun, and therefore I totally disagree with the statement that hobbies need to be difficult in order to be enjoyable.",
        "",
        "On the one hand, many people enjoy easy hobbies. One example of an activity that is easy for most people is swimming. This hobby requires very little equipment and can be learned easily. I remember learning to swim at my local swimming pool when I was a child, and it never felt like a demanding or challenging experience. Another hobby that I find easy and fun is photography. In my opinion, anyone can take interesting pictures without knowing too much about the technicalities of operating a camera. Despite being straightforward, taking photos is a satisfying activity.",
        "",
        "Conversely, difficult hobbies can sometimes be more exciting. If an activity is more challenging, we might feel a greater sense of satisfaction when we manage to do it successfully. For example, skydiving as this requires a high level of knowledge and can be very dangerous if not performed properly. In my case, It took me three years before I became confident and did skydiving from 4000m above sea level, but now I enjoy it much more than I did when i started. I believe that hobbies give us more pleasure when we reach a higher level of performance because the results are better and the feeling of achievement is greater.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, simple hobbies can be fun and relaxing, but difficult hobbies can be equally pleasurable for different reasons."
