        "Nowadays, in some countries, people are earning extremely high wages and for that reason, some people think that it is good for the country, while other individuals believe that the authorities should put limits and control on people's earnings. In this essay, I will look at both views and I will explain why I think that the government should not limit and control people's earnings.",
        "On the one hand, earning high salaries helps to satisfy the employer's needs. To illustrate this, those people are working harder and more intelligent in their work, the companies paid them well, this is because they are hardworking employers and worth  it. Furthermore, It also helps to grow and progress in a particular country. In other words, if employers will be paid well then they do their work more efficiently and put extra effort to push their country one step ahead. For example, In the USA average salary of a UI/UX designer is $84,000 per annum as a result,  worker satisfaction in the country is much higher compared to other nations and for that reason, they always helping hand with their government. Hence, a higher salary is good for a particular nation.",
        "On the other hand, if the government control and limits people's earnings then it leads to  migration. For example, in 2017, more than 5 lakhs Indians migrated from India to Canada and the USA, this is because they do not earn a high salary in their domestic country.  The government should organise a policy for middle-class people who earn low salaries and stabilise their income. Also, the authority should give them some security and benefits along with their minimum wages instead of earning tax from their little income. For example, the Scandinavian government put a high tax of about 55% on rich people and high security and benefits for poor people.",
        "To conclude, In my opinion, the government should not limit  public income they should increase tax on rich people and organise policies for labour and workers to stabilise their little income."
