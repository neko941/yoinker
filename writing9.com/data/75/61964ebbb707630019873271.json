        "Nowadays , all over the world , environmental protection is a big matter of concern . There are many factors leading to a bad condition of the surroundings . Some people argue that the public can do nothing to solve these issues , and only the government and big authorities can take action  to reduce these problems . In my opinion , it is the duty of both to improve the conditions . I partially agree with the given statement .",
        "To begin with , individuals can  stop doing deforestation  . For instance , there are many places from where the flora is cut down to  constructing factories and so on even that industries affects badly to the surroundings and leading to many problems . If the cutting of trees stoped by individuals , it will be more beneficial to the community . Furthermore , they can plant more and more trees . Although there are many places where is no cultivation of crops , they can be used to plant flora for the well-being of the environment . If the greenery is spread widely , it really helps to cope up with the situation .",
        "On the other hand , the government and big companies can encourage the citizens to plant trees . To illustrate, there are many ways in which they can encourage the citizens , like by providing free plants from nurseries and so on  , or by holding events in which people are taught about the benefits of saving the environment . Moreover , the authority can implement strict  rules towards deforestation . Even though there are many people who do deforestation for their survival , it affects the habitat very badly . When the authority implements strict rules , humans will think hundred of times while cutting a tree .",
        "All in all , although the individual can also play a vital role in improving the environment by planting many trees , the government can take actions like implementing strict rules to ensure the changes ."
