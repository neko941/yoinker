        "Some people argue that students should have their personal laptops starting from high school in order to boost their studying. In my opinion, while there are both disadvantages and advantages, I believe that owning personal devices will definite prepare them for the future.",
        "On one hand, some might argue that using computers might cause students to lose their focus quickly. Because of many options available via laptops such as games, websites, photos or videos, many tend to look out for those contents rather than studying. For example, while researching for essays or presentations, they may check out social media or surf websites and forget what was the task they meant to do. Therefore, owning a laptop might distract students from studying.",
        "On the other hand, laptops provide some clear advantages as they are great supporting tools.

I am certain that outcomes such as developing self-studying and computer skills are important to students. However, parents and schools need to monitor and educate students so that they do not misuse and overuse their devices."
