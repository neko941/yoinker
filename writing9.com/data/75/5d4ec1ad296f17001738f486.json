        "There is an ongoing debate on punishing teenagers the same way like how adults are punished for their crimes. Therefore, I strongly disagree to this statement that teenagers should be punished in the same manner. In this essay I will discuss why I don\u2019t agree to the above statement.",
        "Many people think that punishment should be same for all. For example, treating young children and adult criminals in the same manner whether it is a minor or major crime. Moreover, it is a bad idea to treat people the same way. However, if one has done a minor crime like stealing something from a shop, he can be advised not to do in the future rather than punishing him. Or one can just threaten him. Thus, it will make him feel that what he has done is wrong and he will not repeat that in future.",
        "On the other hand, it is always the best idea to punish adult criminals who have committed a crime like murder. These people should not only be punished instead they should be treated with the lethal injection. For instance, in China there is a law that whoever commits a major crime like murdering someone he should be given a lethal injection. Therefore, the crimes will be limited in the fear of lethal injection.",
        "To conclude, I strongly disagree that young children should be given the same punishment because they are teenagers and if people make them understand in a pleasant manner they will not commit any crime in the future. Whereas in the case of adult criminal it is the opposite, meaning they should be severely punished."
