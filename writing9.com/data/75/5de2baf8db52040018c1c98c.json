        "Respected Sir,",
        "I have been a regular visitor at your renowned hotel and always prefer to stay here during my every visit to Delhi. The wonderful ambience of the hotel along with the courteous staff has always fascinated me. However, my last visit was a sheer disappointment.",
        "Last Saturday I visited Delhi for one day for my business meeting and stayed at your hotel. After the whole tiring day when I came to relax in my room, I noticed that the air-conditioner was not working. Moreover, the ceiling fan was also non-functional, it was the hot summer night with a recorded temperature of 48 degrees and it was extremely unbearable for me to stay in the non-airy room.",
        "Therefore, I immediately complained about the situation to the available staff and requested them to change my room. They simply denied my request and sent one person to repair the air-conditioner but he was not able to fix it. What is more, I had to board my return flight early in the morning and no sleep for the whole night made me restless.",
        "Considering the severity of the problem, I request you to take some measures to tackle such kind of issues. Primarily, the hotel employees should be instructed to resolve the issues of visitors on time. Next, the proper maintenance of the infrastructure should be done for its proper functioning, in order to provide a pleasant stay.",
        "Looking forward to immediate actions.",
