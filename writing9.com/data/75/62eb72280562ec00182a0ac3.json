        "Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. In this essay, I will discuss both notions and explain why I consider such actions from the governments  essential.",
        "To begin with, it is understandable why some are against the use of public funds to protect endangered languages. Firstly, many global issues need more urgent support than the extinction of minority languages. For example, hunger and greenhouse emissions, though progress has been made on such matters, more investment is still needed to solve them totally. In addition, in terms of infrastructure, it is argued that public money should be spent to improve the cities both in quality and quantity. Fundamental public places, like hospitals and schools, should be upgraded and built often to enhance the quality of life.",
        "However, I believe that money should be allocated to protect and preserve endangered languages. It is evident that every language is associated with cultural identity, and losing a language means the loss of a whole way of living for instance. In many multicultural nations, minority groups speak a different language, and it creates diversity in society. Nevertheless, some minority languages, which have existed for thousands of years, have almost become extinct as the old generations pass away and the younger generations speak a different language. As a result, without any intervention from the national leaders, it will lead to indifferent identity among everyone and eventually the fade of diversity.",
        "In conclusion, with the aforementioned, as more minority languages are on the verge of extinction, it is vital for the government to allocate funds to save them in order to avoid the potential consequence of homogeneity."
