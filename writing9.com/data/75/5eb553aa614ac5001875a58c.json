        "The techniques of enhancing the public health has become a highly debatable issue in the recent times. Many intellectuals suggest the sports and exercise is the optimized way to keep the society healthy, while others opine that the physical exercise is not only enough to build safer and secure community. This essay will discuss both these views, along with my opinion further.",
        "To begin with, the former view is emphasising the crucial role of physical exercise on the public health. The sports and games are the best way to keep people fit and boost up their immunity. As a result, the passive threats to the society such as obesity, depression and blood-sugar can be prevented at early stages. Although, the sports complexes need high investments by the local councils, it provides innumerable advantages for the people in the long term. For instance, the influence of sports on the youth will build the generations with high physical strength and prevent the possibilities of disease. Thus, the healthy community could be formed by effective numbers of sports centres.",
        "However, the latter view is illustrating the limitation of the sports and physical exercise. It is irrefutable that the senior citizens and elder women could not utilize the sports facilities to be healthy. Consequently, the administration should expand their medical services to the people to provide them best treatments. Moreover, the authority could motivate the citizens towards healthy and organic food; which will elevate their immunity and keep them fit. For example, the soaring consumption of junk food is a predominant reason for the degrading health of the students. Therefore, they must be guided to consume nutritious food.",
        "In conclusion, the public health plays a vital role in the development of the society. In my opinion, the government should improve not only the sports facilities, but also expands the medical facilities for the betterment of the citizens. Thus, the every member of the community can stay healthy and happy."
