        "Some people are in favour of spending the greatest part of the money to make new railway lines for speedy trains throughout the country. However, others think that budget ought to be used to enhance transportation methods currently in the cities. This essay will examine both views and include my notion regarding the topic.",
        "On the one hand, people who are prone to the environment want advanced transportation methods, such as trains which utilize electricity as a kind of fuel. These trains are much faster than obsolete ones but this is not the most significant reason because there is a bigger concern about coal trains\u2019 effects on the environment. Modern trains are less getting off carbon dioxide into the air and this gas does not stem from using electricity. It comes from energy production ways, such as dams or power plants, so it has not a direct effect on the planet. Therefore, many people think their future generations advocate constructing many railway lines.",
        "On the other hand, in today\u2019s world, most people live in crowded cities and these cities mostly use buses which were bought a long time ago as a tool for public transportation. For this reason, citizens can notice readily their gas emission into the air and they strongly believe that as mass transportation has the highest usage rates, the government need to give priority to renewing them. Hence, people who avoid using them may alter opinions against out-of-date buses and we might decrease the air pollution. According to my personal opinion, we need to spend our budget on changing existing mass transportation ways.",
        "In conclusion, as it can be seen from the above, there are two reasonable views about how the budget should be spent. Both of them can aim to rise both comfort and environmental vulnerability."
