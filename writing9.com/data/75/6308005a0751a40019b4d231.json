        "It is believed that by many individuals our cultural background comes from where we were born , others claim that it can be affected in minimum dosage. However, I would argue that  most cultural heritage is generated by the  environment where we have grown up.",
        "To begin with, human beings are born and die in some certain habitat and during this certain time  individually become  a person by his/her own character. That is to say, people are  influenced by the environment where they live . Latins, for instance, it is well-known  they are good at dance.Those who are born in Latin countries are highly likely influenced by their country's lifestyles. Hence, it is obvious fact that each country  creates its own culture.",
        "On the other hand, not only does our homeland build the culture which we shape , and also individual effort can be counted. This means that  a person can be acted in another's countries' behaviour and lifestyle. For the UK residents , for example, there are lots of different ethnic inhabitants who live there and mostly live as same as  British in this country. Consequently, human beings can shape their personality easily in  certain living environments.",
        "In conclusion, it is  hotly debated where cultural background  where comes from. In my own perspective, a significant part of our culture stems from the land where we were born as well as the environment, where we continued to live also affects us."
