        "In this era, knowledge about natural habitats is sadly not widely known. The reasons for this may be numerous; however, there are a few main causes for which solutions can be suggested.",
        "The two chief sources of this trend are poor education and the lack of social campaigns. First and foremost, it is likely that people possess little knowledge about the natural world since they are insufficiently taught about this topic in schools. Indeed, most academic programs in many countries only focus on theory instead of providing students with practice. For instance, children are not able to learn about how ecosystems work without truly witnessing that with their own eyes. This leads to the fact that lessons about nature are easily forgotten and diluted. Secondly, this tendency may be the result of the lack of social campaigns. Specifically, these campaigns would be able to educate a great number of citizens about nature with the support of media development. However, they do not receive sufficient investments, which results in the fact that there are few contents shown to the public with little quality.",
        "As a consequence, a few steps can be taken to tackle this problem. Firstly, academic programs should be redesigned with more practical contents. For example, there could be more extracurricular activities for students to obtain some actual experience by visiting nature conservation areas or zoos. Besides, the government should consider investing greater financial resources in making social campaigns about the natural world. In particular, the content should be interesting enough to capture public attention, imprint the relevant knowledge in their minds, and compete with commercials in terms of on-air time.",
        "In general, the shortage of practical contents in schools and the low number of social campaigns are the two major causes, and making positive adjustments to education and governmental funding are two possible solutions to this issue."
