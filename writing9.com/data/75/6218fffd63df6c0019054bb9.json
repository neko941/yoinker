        "Many societies have opinions about we have too many alternatives these days . However , others disagree with this statement .  In my opinion , I completely agree with this mind .",
        "Nowadays are robots and technology days . Science is fastly developing . For this reason , we have many choices . For instance , in the modern world robots can do many things instead of humans . People do not have to waste time on everything.   We have a preference for education . It is easy to get quality education from generous teachers on social media and you don't have to go to their homes.  In addition , if you want to learn a foreign language , you can use  different kinds of programs . Therefore , many  people believe that we have many opportunities now .",
        "On the other hand , we have decreased our choices nowadays . People's discoveries are becoming the reason for many people can not find a good job around the world and people suffering from this .  Some people think that nowadays we have no choices such as past . In my opinion , they thought that in ancient times people were less than now . And there were a lot of food products .",
        "In conclusion , I completely agree that we have too many choices nowadays . In fact , everything has been facilitated now . We have more opportunities rather than earlier ."
