        "There are many people who have called into question the lack of recycling in the world.While I think, to a certain, extent governments should enforce reprocessing  laws on households, I also believe that the education about reusable materials  is more crucial.",
        "It is undeniable that recycling programs require co-operation from the public and this cannot be achieved without enhancements comprehension.The administrations  should therefore inculcate people about the benefits involved, as well as how to sort trash into different bins.For trying to change the person\u2019s mentality from a young age, children have to work in this field to learn the significance of reusing materials.Furthermore, education from early times, has a vast role in individual",
        "Habits which contains our lifestyle.For instant, In Scandinavian countries, teachers educate children while working with them in the natural environment. Many researchers corroborates, recycling is emerging  in these lands because of awareness.",
        "On the other hand, the Regulations should certainly exist to ensure individuals sort through their household refuse to separate reusable materials. Even when citizens know about the advantages of doing this, However do not fear punishment and not participate in it, there are more likely to produce added waste.As a precaution, if residents face penalties for neglecting environmental, protection rules, they would be more likely to take the extra few minutes, to place plastics, papers in proper bins rather that waste them.For example, in Singapore rates of recycling is the highest because of their substantial  fines compare to the other part of the world.",
        "In conclusion, as exploiting waste through different salvaging processes protect the environment, governments should make it a legal punishment for people who are reluctant to do their part.Nevertheless, concurrent to implementing these laws, administrations should educate citizens about this process."
