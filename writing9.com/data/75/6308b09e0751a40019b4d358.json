        "There is always  contention between people regarding  university education. Some individuals think that more  students are getting higher education compared previously ; the rest of them believe that every student must have a right to get this education. This essay will generate my opinion after making a discussion on both sides of this argument.",
        "On the one side, the admission number of learners at university is increasing day by day. This is due to the fact that the masses want to upgrade their educational status which would aid them in getting better employment in terms of salary and position. In other words, the higher the education degree a person has, the higher position he will get at a company. As an illustration, multi-national companies always prefer to recruit those employees who have post-graduation in a special discipline. Therefore, it is clear that to get a respected position at the job site, many individuals go to university for higher education.",
        "On the other side, some sections of society including myself, reckon that it should be a fundamental right so that each and every person would get a university education. In this way, the literacy rate could be increased which will directly lead to fewer crimes and the world becoming a better place to live. Research conducted by the Criminal Department at Pune, for example, shows that there is only 1 per cent of criminals are well educated; the remaining percentage of criminals have low educational levels. Thus, it proves that it must be a universal right so that the literacy rate could be enhanced which will reduce the crime rate.",
        "In conclusion, I think university education should be accessible to every student so that crime could be reduced by educating the population, however, others believe that there is a surge in students getting admission to the university for better employment opportunities."
