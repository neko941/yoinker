        "I am writing this letter to let you know the inconvenience that occurred to me when I was at your Parivaar Restaurant on 27th Jan 2022.",
        "There are a couple of reasons to select your eatery at A.S Rao Nagar, Hyderabad. Firstly, one of my friends suggested your place, where chicken biryani is the best. Secondly, it was near to the location where I am residing now. However, my experience was not smooth as I thought it would be.",
        "The rice used in biryani was half cooked. Rice is one of the main ingredients for this dish and unfortunately it was the major turn off. Moreover, the quantity provided was insufficient for one. The bowl itself was decent sized but the amount of food inside was a drawback.",
        "However, I would like to suggest a few improvements for the above-mentioned problems. Cooking the rice for 5-10 minutes more should be good to make it perfect and increasing the amount of food by small margins will be ideal as well. By making these changes there would be more customers and revenue in total.",
        "Looking forward to improving refinement to the mentioned problems.",
