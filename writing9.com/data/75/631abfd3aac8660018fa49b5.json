        "Some people argued that experts or specialists who had professional skills should stay in their nations, however, other people think that professionals have the freedom to choose the place they want instead of asking them back to the country they did training.",
        "On the one hand, it is so common that governments would provide scholarships to train potential specialists and sign a contract to ensure that these professionals will stay in the countries. From the government's perspective, they look forward to preserving some outstanding experts and believe these trained people will contribute to our society. For example, people who are rewarded with free tuition as their scholarship can put more emphasis on their work, sharpening their skills as possible as they need. This means that they got more opportunities to pursue better skills and achievements. Therefore, the specialists who received the scholarship but didn\u2019t stay would be a huge loss to  society.",
        "On the other hand, other people believe that we all have options to select the nation we want to live. It\u2019s not only about human rights but also the lifestyle we pursue. For instance, some of the contracts required trained professionals should serve in the countryside for at least five years, however, we all understand it is not convenient at all. Sometimes, the resources are lacking, it will be difficult if doctors want to have complicated surgery in a small hospital.",
        "In summary, I partly agree that trained specialists should stay in their country and provide their skills to society. If they have gained the scholarship and service from the government, it is necessary to follow the contract and contribute to the place that offered training."
