        "I, Paulami Sanyal, a student of 2nd year of college, am currently sharing a room with one of my classmates. She is from a different stream. We have been sharing this room for the last  year.",
        "Her time of study does not match with mine. She prefers to study mostly at night so the room\u2019s lights are on during this time. While I prefer to wake up early in the morning and rest during the night. Hence my rest time is being compromised. Also she has a habit of playing loud music and inviting friends into the room. This also hampers my study. Somehow I managed to perform well in my 1st-year examination but it will definitely impact the study of the next year.",
        "So I would like to request you to kindly change my room if possible. I would prefer the single room as it will be ideal for me to concentrate more on my study. Attached toilet would be great.",
        "Thank you very much in advance. Awaiting your response.",
