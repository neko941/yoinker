        "Many people believe that spending most of the time on computers prepare children for future jobs and research works, while others argue it to have the negative impact on them. In my opinion, there should be a limit to its usage as excess of everything is bad.",
        "Using computers for most of the tasks, teenagers get prepared to work for long hours on it, which help them to get ready for their studies and work life, later on. Moreover, they get knowledge by browsing various educational contents available on various sources on computers, which definitely help them in their studies and there are various applications available which encourage them towards exploring and learning.",

        "In conclusion, computer usage for children can prove to be mostly positive if it is supervised properly and done in limit."
