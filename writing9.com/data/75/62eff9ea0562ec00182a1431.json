        "Some people believe that the fund for education should invest in  advanced computers, while others assume that the fund should invest more in  teachers. I strongly believe that investing in teachers is the best way for spending a vast of money.",
        "On the one hand, it is necessary for spending more money on  computers because  students prefer to study in front of the digital screen than offline, especially in this pandemic era. This phenomenon is started commonly in this growth of  technology. To take an example, a lot of children are able to obtain  information via the internet in a short time. As a result, some countries have  spent tons of money for getting the newest computer at their school. In addition, the parents who are born in the 20th century commonly support this.",
        "Even though many people invest in computers, other groups keep investing their money in teachers. They believe that there are some aspects which cannot replace by the computer. The first is about attitude, this aspect is not able to be changed by the computer, and we know that well-behaved is really needed by the learner for their future and it cannot be taught by  technology. Secondly, learning-method by the computer is usually monotone and has limitations. This affects  learning progress and sometimes makes the learner feels bored. As a result, they are not able to comprehend the subject as well as the process that is done by the teacher.",
        "To sum up, i agree with the second statement, even though the first statement has benefits for the student. Attitude is not the only  aspect that cannot be changed by  technology, but also learning-method. These aspects  make me prefer to stand with the second argument."
