        "However, because of our midterms, my roommate has been inviting his classmates for reviewing course books which could take until midnight. As a result, I am not able to sleep properly since noise level and brightness do not let me get some rest. If you look at my scores, you will notice that I have not been performing as good enough as used to be.",
        "I would like to move the 1-bed room in your dormitory.  Scheduling my daily routine independently without any disruption from other people would be healthy for me as well as beneficial for increasing my grades.",
        "I hope you can consider my letter and take the necessary steps to put me in a 1-person unit.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
