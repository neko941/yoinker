        "Since, as you know that I am preparing for the IIT exam and I have to study for the whole day for at least  14 hours so at night I really need to have a good sleep to relax  but your music system does bother me a lot .",
        "So, for this problem I would like to suggest the solutions which can help me to have a proper sleep , Firstly, can you please keep the volume down of your music system and also you can shut the doors and windows, so that voice doesn't come out.",
        "I am really expecting a sort of help from your end.",
