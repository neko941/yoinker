Although there is an argument that spending most of the time on computers can pose a detrimental impact on adolescents, I strongly believe that it is beneficial and no harmful to teenagers. I will thoroughly present my view in the following part.",
        "First of all, it is undeniable that the merits of computer provide for a youngster are really enormous. As a high-tech tool, computers can bring an ideal education atmosphere for children. For example,they easily do some research about some particular things which are still mysterious  Moreover, children can find more intriguing videos on youtube or any kind of entertainment website which help them expand their own knowledge horizon in this little world. In addition, the variety of sources on the internet is also a useful weapon for them especially for those who are eager to explore  the unknown on this planet. It is widely proved and accepted by both parents and teachers",
        "On the other hand, the negative effect of computers is something unavoidable. Most children spend their time  playing  computer games or watching movies on the internet which lead to some bad consequences such as lose interest in the study and they can easily get  disease-related optical problems. Furthermore, they can also lose their interaction and connection with their family members, friends and some other close-knit relationships. Using a computer for many hours can also affect  both physical and mental issues which cause some negative repercussions in a long run.",
