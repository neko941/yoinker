        "There is a point of view from citizens that expresses recycling waste from homes is not adequate. Actually, I agree with this opinion that codifying rules and laws by the administration to raise the level of recycling.",
        "Significantly, most people heard \"Dirty gold\" nowadays. This expression is related to the worth of waste. It is a fact that wastes which pull out from industrial factories, agricultural lands and also human homes should be a rich financial source if everyone pays enough attention to reprocessing excretory material to recover reusable material. So as a significant topic, it is necessary that a valid organ such as the government or global union manage and arrange a consequent plan for the long term. Moreover, they could prevent excess payment, destructive kinds of stuff for the environment and reduce carbon dioxide and high-risk fumes degree in airpullotion.",
        "In addition, based on popular knowledge \"union is strength\" so it is really appreciated that society is struggling in this way but generally it is not enough. Anyway, people must break up their dry waste of wet ones in their homes. It is the reason that speed of recycling is increased and did not spend extra energy and money. Totally government's supervision could make a situation with an atmosphere's balance besides focusing on numerous huger projects for development powerfully.",
        "By way of conclusion, both aspects of help (townsmen and politicians) are vital. For example, Sravan's tragedy is repeated in case the government leave people alone. So they should be more sensitive to ecological issues before it will be too late and will happen another crisis!"
