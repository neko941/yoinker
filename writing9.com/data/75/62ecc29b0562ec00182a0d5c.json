        "Nowadays, there have been serious issues regarding the behaviour of students in schools. In this essay, I will give my opinion on the causes of those problems that have an impact on their behaviour and I will provide my suggestions for solving this point.",
        "Firstly, the main point of problem that causes  trouble for students is the lack of competent teachers. In other words, the lack of capable professors can cause damage to the learning process of their students. For instance, teachers who are incompetent and do not know how to teach students usually make a lot of mistakes and do not explain a vivid picture of study materials or provide useful suggestions to them. In contrast, if teachers are experts and knowledgeable, those problems, which students may be faced with, can be easily solved and explained to the students who do not understand those points clearly. However, I believe that lacking competent professors can be resolved by using a lot of funding in order to attract capable professors to work with.",
        "Secondly, the secondary problem of student attitude is the lack of technologies or facilities for students while they are studying. For example, insufficient technologies and facilities during studying or after studying can cause a bad impact on the approach to teaching the student because sometimes  lacking technologies and facilities may affect students on the way of accessing good study materials or others. Nevertheless, I think that this point can be resolved by finding another way of teaching.",
        "In conclusion, Many states confront the issues of student attitude in school, however, I think that this problem can be solved  in the future."
