        "After the manufacturing boom utilizing of different natural materials soared. As a result, the number of woods subsided dramatically due to deforestation which led to the extinction of various species and loss of biodiversity. This essay will point out primary causes as well as come up with some solutions to the problem.",
        "To begin with, the rarer the animal is the more it will cost. Therefore, thousands of illegal hunters kill lots of unique animals in order to sell them on the black market. Moreover, ancient medicines, such as Chinese, suggest making use of weird mixtures as a cure for every single ailment. As an example, citizens of China squandered money for decades buying so-called \u00abdragon bones\u00bb, although they were deceived. In fact, people were purchasing dinosaur bones, which were discovered nearby.",
        "Possible solutions to these problems would be, firstly reducing the number of illegal hunting. If we state heavy punishments, such cases will decrease. Secondly, we should work out another method of crafting paper and other stuff made of wood. For instance, the latest research in the United States revealed the merits of products made of cannabis over wooden analogues.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, this essay made an effort to disclose the problem of exhausting the ecosystem as well as suggested several ways to deal with this trouble, which is one the most horrid nowadays. In addition, the resources of the planet should be shared among human beings and wild creatures in reasonable proportions to avert the dying out of innocent creatures."
