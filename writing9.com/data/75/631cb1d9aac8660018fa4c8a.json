        "I am writing this letter to you to keep you informed of the condition of the road in front of my house. My name is Nayomi Perera and I reside at house no 16, Rose avenue.  I\u2019ve been living in Rose Avenue since December 2021, and I am greatly disappointed that it has been quite a while since we\u2019ve had a visit from the municipal council to assess the damage to the road.",
        "Due to the continuous bad weather conditions during the past few months, the road is in bad shape. There are deep puddles which have led to cracking of the road,  and as a result, it is an obstruction for vehicle movement.",
        "May I suggest an assessment visit from an engineer from the authority to check on the status of our road, you may need to tar the road as soon as possible to avoid further damage.  Greatly appreciate your quick action regarding  this.",
