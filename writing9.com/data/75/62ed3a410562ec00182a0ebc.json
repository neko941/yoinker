        "Face-to-face communication is being replaced by keeping in touch using social media. Live communication enjoyers think that it saves from communication with dishonesty and people with faked identities, whereas the internet generation argues that communication through social media is more convenient and easier for introverts. Moreover, with social media it might even be easier not to communicate, was there a need. I agree with such a sentiment and in the following essay, I will try to explain my point of view.",
        "To begin with, contacting through social media is more convenient. Take, for example, friends living in different countries - while face-to-face contact is by no means possible, social media lets them keep in touch. Furthermore, introverts can answer whenever they want, since there's no pressure to do it in real-time. Besides, if an individual is harassing, bullying or et cetera, one can just block that person. It all adds up to a conversation that is comfortable for all the participants.",
        "On the other hand, face-to-face communication means seeing each other. Therefore, it makes it harder to manipulate, lie, or be dishonest in other ways. To give a clear example, breaking up using text messages is a grave mistake, which costs misunderstandings and superfluous anger. Simultaneously, seeing each other face to face is important during this fake news and false identities era, when even profiles with a photo can be scams or worse.",
        "To conclude, contact in real life provides more honesty and less anxiety about a person's real identity. Nevertheless, social media gives more flexibility over distance and time. On top of that, it lets the person choose people with whom they want to communicate or not. That is the reason why, in my opinion, the advantages of communication through social media outweigh the disadvantages."
