        "Some people debate that young people who decide their career path in advance and keep pursuing it will be met with more success and happiness of career life. From my perspective, I think that the key factors which determine one\u2019s satisfaction of career life is not based on how many times they switch their job. I will outline some reasons in the essay below.",
        "On the one hand, it is undeniable that people who choose a particular career path early and keep pursuing it will have more change to thrive in that chosen field, especially in some jobs which require hand-on experience such as doctor or pilot\u2026 In other words, people working in one specialized career have more time to enhance their vital skills and abilities for the job as well as get used to with the high-pressure workload, resulting in higher promotion prospects and more effective productivity. For instance, a veteran employee is always considered to be more valuable than any fresh-recruits in the company. Furthermore, people having a long period of loyalty and higher position in the enterprise will be paid with the most respect by the junior employees, leading to their satisfying career life. Indeed, it is extremely proud to be called as the boss in the working environments.",
        "On the other hand, it is also beneficial for those who change job frequently, from people who love experiencing many career to job-hoppers who feel bored with their current job. Firstly, by altering job in every short period, people have more opportunities to meet and make friend with more people from all over the world, which contributes to the enhancement of the circle of social relationship. As a consequence, the more relationship they got, the more success prospect they have in the future. Secondly, some people become job-hoppers due to the repetition of the job which brings about boredom and frustration. This is because they are not satisfied with the daily work and have a strong desire of figuring out what they actually interested in.",
        "In conclusion, it seems to be advantageous to have a decision about career trajectory as soon as possible. However, I think that keep following the chosen way does not guarantee job satisfaction later in life."
