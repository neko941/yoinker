        "Nowadays, the majority of people neglect to recycle their domestic waste. For this reason, some people consider that new legislation to force people to recycle could alleviate this situation. Personally, while I agree with this statement, I argue that there are also some other governmental interventions which should be taken.",
        "First and foremost, it is an undeniable fact that  implementing new laws regarding waste management, would be an effective way to tackle the waste problem. Specifically, many households throw plastic bottles, tin cans and glass containers into their general rubbish, which should otherwise be separated into different recycling bins. Therefore, authorities should impose strict  fines for those who neglect to separate their recyclables appropriately. For instance, in Canada , there are certain fines of 800-1000$ for those who are offenders. Thus, it is clear that through this measure, a high percentage of citizens have the opportunity to adopt better recycling and disposal habits.",
        "In addition, governments should do more than simply introduce a recycling law. It might be more effective if they could launch recycling campaigns to alert society to the urgency of environmental conservation. Moreover, a further measure that could be taken is to foster recycling values in schools through experimental projects for students. Last but not least, a significant tactic would be if authorities create stricter regulations for the companies that produce the packaging for household products. This way, the public may become more environmentally conscious and will be interested in protecting their surroundings.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, there are numerous efforts of enhancing  waste management among citizens. However, I strongly believe that new recycling legislation even would definitely be an effective initiative , there is the only significant one at all."
