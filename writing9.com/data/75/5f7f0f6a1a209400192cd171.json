        "There is a great deal of strong developing in the agriculture fields. However, there are a large number of people still suffer from a lack of food. Although there will undoubtedly be negative consequences of this trend, solutions can be taken to mitigate these potential problems.",

This demand a greater food for people while developing in the other sectors take away part of the land in agriculture where may have a lot of advantages for previous agricultural development. For example, people are trying to enlarge land on bank rivers or side deltas for manufactures, infrastructure development and so on. Therefore, although there is the obviously advance made in farming, however it was not still enough to meet all people around the globe. The second main issue is climate change is becoming severe. This is because of many various causes, most of them are coming from human impact. Some extreme weather events are affecting seriously on food productions such as long storms or droughts. People who are living in places of those natural disasters are likely the lack of food at a high frequency.",

Firstly, it is essential to the government of each country to give their citizen with new laws in order to regulate their country's population reasonably. This will avoid the burden of the shortage of food worldwide in general. Secondly, it is also important to governments and organizations work together in order to get more effective in decrease heavy damage because of the extreme climate events.
