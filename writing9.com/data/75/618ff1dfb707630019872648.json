        "Dear John,",
        "I hope you are doing well. I am writing this letter to let you know that I know you're going on a camping holiday this summer for the very first time at the place called Luis Lake in Central North America.",
        "I know that you will definitely going to enjoy  camping at Luis lake. As, I had done camping at beautiful Luis Lake back in 2019. Let me tell you about some attractive locations nearby the place where you will going to attend.",
        "To be honest, a camping holiday has several disadvantages as well. Firstly, as we are living in Eastern North America, our current season is winter and Central North America has summer season going on right now. So, It is going to be a massive temperature change for our body which may lead to fever, cough or any other temporary problems.  Well, I'm thinking about coming on this camping holiday with you as I'm having a summer break at my University.",
