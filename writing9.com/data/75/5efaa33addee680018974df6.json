        "It is believed by some people that to have success in sports it is important to have physical strength rather than mental strength. However other people believe that the other way around is more important. In this essay, I will explain both views and my opinion.",
        "Firstly, physical strength is good you can make other people afraid to come closer because the body seems strong. Furthermore, for some kinds of sports, this is sometimes important. For example, rugby, American football, and art-martial. In my viewpoint, for this sport having more muscles will help to achieve the best scores.",
        "On the other hand, mental strength is necessary for other kinds of sports, such as chess, football, tennis, and golf. Moreover, thinking about the game and using the strategies will be more important than having muscles. For example, you cannot win chess with physical power, it is better you rather have the mental power to succeed. In my opinion, to have mental strength is always good and you can use it in other sports also that needs stronger bodies because being clever and mentally prepared can help anyone to succeed.",
        "In conclusion, In my opinion, physical and mental power is important in different circumstances, having success in sports and depends on which sports you want to practice and play. However, using clever strategies and be mentally prepared can help people to succeed in all places and sports rather than have strong bodies. Because of this, I agree with the statement that mental strength is more important for success in sport."
