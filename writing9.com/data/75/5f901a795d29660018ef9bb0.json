        "It is thought by some that the most important environmental issue we are facing now is the decline of certain lines of animals and vegetation. Others, however, believe that there are more serious problems to worry about. While The disappearance of certain species can lead to ecological imbalance, I believe that environmental hazards that threaten the lives of all species are more important.",
        "On the one hand, some are concerned about the extinction of certain species because their loss destroys the balance of the ecosystem. Every species in the ecosystem has a certain function that contributes to its ability and if one is lost this will consequently disrupt the ecosystem processes that are maintained by the specific species. For example, in the 1920s, a government policy allowed the extermination of grey wolves in Yellowstone which triggered the explosion of elk population resulting in severe overgrazing of Willows and Aspens needed by beavers for food and shelter leading to their virtual disappearance and ecosystem collapse.",
        "On the other hand, some consider other environmental problems that affect the entire life on Earth as more important. In our recent time, there are many environmental hazards that threaten not only the balance of our ecosystem but it's survival. For instance, the issue of global warming and climate change which is expected to have detrimental effects on every living entity on the planet Earth. I believe that such problems should be seen as more important and must be tackled because they may eventually lead to The disappearance of any form of life existing now.",
        "In conclusion, although the decline of certain animals and plants is sometimes seen as the most serious environmental problem of our recent time because it results in ecological imbalance, there are other more worrying issues such as global warming that straightens the life of every creature in this planet."
