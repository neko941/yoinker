        "In the 21st century, some people argue that we now have various elements and substances which can replace animals to produce meals and also supply to the medical and garment industry. From my viewpoint, I partially agree with this opinion.",
        "On the one hand, it is true to say that things made from those living things can bring some results that others can\u2019t do, especially food. The fact is people need to be provided with enough nutrients to live a fit and healthy life. For example, protein, which is an important ingredient for the human body, is hardly found in substitute materials for meat such as green vegetables. The elements which exist in them help us to make more delicious cuisines, more salutary medicines, and also more durable, better fabrics.",
        "On the other hand, the abuse of consuming creatures to manufacture things can put some threats to their life. For instance, several endangered species have been killed each year to make high-priced drugs and extravagant interior decorations such as rhino\u2019s horn and elephant ivory. With the rapid growth of technology, scientists now can mix different substances to create things that have similar tastes and quality of meat which will reduce indiscriminate and illegal hunting.",
        "All things considered, animals have many features and characteristics that others don\u2019t have to make a plentiful product for serving our demands. Nevertheless, the utilization of them for creating daily necessities should be limited, but doesn't stop using them to avoid bad effects and save some species from extinction."
