        "In this fast-moving era, education is the most important thing in everyone\u2019s life in most nations lookup is believed to the superior to declining  crime but education is the best way to reduce the increasing crime rate day by day. Both play the same role in punishment as well as education to decrease  crime. In upcoming paragraphs, I will discuss both views and give my opinion.",
        "Firstly, there are lots of steps to reduce the crime rate which is inclining at a high rate as government should take strict action against criminals. For example, if somebody did a crime and  was prisoned for seven years so, he had to do hard work In his prison  time then, he would never think of doing crimes in his future life. Additionally, most of the crimes are committed by unemployed persons.",
        "On the other hand, education also plays a vital role to reduce the crime rate  if someone gets a good education and is employed in a public or private sector he does not think of doing crimes. for instance, A survey was conducted last year by the \u201cTimes of India\u201d and it can be clearly seen that the most of crimes were done by illiterate individuals in comparison to the educated ones. In the USA crime rate is low due to high literacy rate. Furthermore, authorities will start awareness programmes to stop crime rates these activities make people  do their best in their life.",
        "To conclude this, strict actions as well as education play an important role. In my opinion, education is best to reduce the crime rate ."
