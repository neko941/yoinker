        "It is true that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this tendency, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.",
        "As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden for working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the fact young adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.",
        "There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people whose age is above 60 tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. Another measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent on vital health care, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of older citizens.",
        "In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older."
