        "In this contemporary era , learning children new things is very hard for parents therefore many parents think that childcare services are best for children for pre-education. However, some think that grandparents should be best for kids. In this essay , I would explain both points and give my opinion in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, nowadays many parents do not give time to their children because they have a busy schedule in their job and other work so they send their children into childcare school when they can learn many things and curriculum activities. For example, nuclear families increasing rapidly so it will be beneficial for both children and parents. Moreover , they can learn from masters so they would be simplified these skills in their academics and it also helps them in their cognitive skills.",
        "However, some people think that grandparents should be best for this kind of activity because they have a lot of experience and also they share some real-life examples with their kids so they can learn rules and regulations easily. For instance, grandparents have courage and skills so they can teach some good practical subjects and share some stories. In addition , children also have strong bonds with their older ones so it will also benefit  them to learn subjects fast and they can trust whatever they learn from them.",
        "To conclude , I strongly believe that both are very important but grandparents should teach because they can teach with some good examples and real-life lessons which really help children in their life."
