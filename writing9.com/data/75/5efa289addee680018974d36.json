        "There is no doubt that these days the role of family members has been change as consequences of changing the family structure. I believe such a change has a negative impact on the family and the community.",
        "In terms of the negative effects, there was an advancement in the science in different perspectives over the past few decades. For instance, medical knowledge has been developed significantly, in which there are many procedures that able to switch the gender. Moreover, such procedures would result in a huge shift in family structure. Consequently, the role of the family eventually will be replaced. For example, instead of a providing father and a caring mother, those acts would be affected in the way that the children have abnormal behaviour. Hence, having a disorganized family will lead us ultimately to a diseased society.",
        "Moreover, guiding the family and to some extent the community either directly, indirectly without a clear and strict rules, as well as arrangement would produce a future generation without a specific goal. This is exemplified clearly in the young group, especially the minors who may attempt some prohibited behaviour, such as drinking alcohol and driving without license. All the above problems would lead to disturbed family, therefore, the society would be greatly affected.",
        "In conclusion, although the family is considered the cornerstone of the community, changing the family character and structure would lead to significant impact on the society. The government and the individuals must ensure the steps are taken to prevent this phenomenon and protect the future generations."
