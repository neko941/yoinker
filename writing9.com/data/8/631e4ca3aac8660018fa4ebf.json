        "In the contemporary era, people are eager for money. It has been observed that inhabitants select jobs in which they can get more money rather than satisfaction. I strongly agree with the above-mentioned notion since money is the essential part of happiness and handling all the expenses of our loved ones.",
        "Firstly, citizens do a plethora of things with the help of money,in order to reduce their stress. For example, youngsters do a lot of highly paid adventure activities and buy expensive things so that they can enjoy their life with their near and dear ones. Unfortunately, this is the thing which cannot be achieved with low-paid jobs. From ,this it becomes quite evident why humans do not prefer those work in which they can get a low salary with less work even though in these jobs they can easily balance their personal and professional life.",
        "Secondly, nowadays, money is required to handle all  family expenses. For instance,currently everything is expensive such as children's school education fees and family medical bills. So folks always prefer to get those jobs in which they can get some additional benefits along with pay such as family medical insurance although they do some extra work to get these advantages. Hence, this makes it clear why common people do not try to get low-salary jobs.",
        "In summary, it is agreed that inhabitants are more interested in those jobs in which they can become financially strong so that they can enjoy their life and pay utility bills for their family members."
