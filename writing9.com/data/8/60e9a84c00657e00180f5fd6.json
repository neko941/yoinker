        "According to few folks, plenty of wealth is the primary reason for happiness. Firstly, to understand the role of money in happiness, this essay shares some perspectives. On the other hand, this essay also explores other avenues in which one can find joy.",
        "Although, it is popularly said that money cannot buy happiness, but it can surely give you the power to purchase those things which can eventually make you happy. For instance, with a fat bank balance, you can build a luxurious villa with all modern amenities. You can own a chauffeur-driven sedan to serve you and your family members. In addition to this, you can travel on a leisure trip to  exotic locations with your near and dear ones. You can stay in a 5-star resort and pamper yourself with luxury and comfort. You really do not have to worry about meeting your ends and can fully enjoy your life.",
        "On the other hand, an alternative perspective illustrates that wealth is not the only means through which you can be elated. There are many other things in life such as helping  needy people and spending time with loved ones can bring you satisfaction and joy.  Firstly, spending time with children at orphanages, teaching them new things and donating for their future education can give you a sense of satisfaction and mental peace.  Secondly, one can find happiness in doing little things with your loved ones such as cooking your favourite dish with your wife or sipping a cup of coffee with your friends. These experiences are a treasure in themselves.",
        "To summarise, having an eight-figure paycheck will allow few people to buy things that make them happy. However, some people find joy in the small nuances of life."
