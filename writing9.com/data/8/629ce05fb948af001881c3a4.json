Hence, without wasting any further time, i decided to take her to the nearest hospital\u2019s emergency ward. However, I observed, that no one was interested in attending to my daughter. Initially, I kept ignoring the situation as I just wanted the doctors to do needful. But none of them was even not ready to register her case; After waiting for four long hours when I lost my patience, I mentioned filing a complaint with the registrar after that a junior doctor came forward and he started performing tests.",
