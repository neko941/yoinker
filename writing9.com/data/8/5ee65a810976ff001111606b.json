        "In the recent times the volume of garbage produced is increasing, what could be the possible reasons for this and what can be done by the officials of country to decrease the production of the waste.",
        "Firstly, I would like to give the main reason that is the quantity of food outside consumed by people is increasing, consequently the waste, increasing because of its packaging in the polythene and other materials which are non-recyclable. Secondly, the overall population has increased, hence the manufacturing and packaging increased. For example: If the demand is more so the supply will automatically be more and in result, it will increase the bulk of garbage production.",
        "On the other hand, if we talk about its prevention then we need to work on the material that we use for the essential item's packaging like for food, etc. The paper packaging or recyclable items should be used which are environmental friendly. For instance: there have been rules in various countries on the ban of plastic packaging and plastic bags by the ruling officials, which will directly impact the ton of waste production. And also there has to be imposed rules by government on the type and impact on the material used by manufacturing companies on the environment and have to make sure that bulk usage of these products are not participating in the garbage production.",
        "So to conclude, I would like to restate that increase in the outside food consumption has impacted the extent of rubbish produced, and it can certainly be contained if we have rules for the materials being used for packaging of the essential items."
