        "Dear Maryam",
        "I hope you are doing well. There is a long time since we haven't seen each other although you have been still my best close friend. Anyway, I'm writing to tell you after working abroad for roughly 4 years I have recently bought a two-story and detached home by taking out the mortgage since if anyone wants to buy a house in this neighbourhood has to pay the earth for it. Even though it is not my dream house but quite cosy and comfortable. The indoor swimming pool and spa are on the first floor and two bedrooms, kitchen and bathroom are on the second floor.  The sitting room and the balcony overlooking a public green space.",
        "The neighbourhood is quite safe and has a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere which makes here a fantastic area for me. My neighbours are quite considerate and quiet which means I can have a pleasurable time on the balcony and enjoy the view without any disturbance. In addition, I have access to all kinds of facilities nearby such as numerous shops and medical resources and so on.",
        "Eventually, as I have missed you a lot, you are warmly invited by me to come here and you know if you come here we will have precious time together seeing that we have many things in common to talk about and visiting in person has been more exhilarating than online meeting on media.",
        "I look forward to meeting you soon.",
        "warm wishes.",
