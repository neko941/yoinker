        "My name is Artem and I was renting your apartment located near the Sherbrooke metro station. The reason I am writing to you is that I have not received the deposit I made to be able to move in with my cat.",
        "Initially it was prohibited to have a cat due to the contract restrictions. But we agreed if I made a deposit that covers the cost of repairing the flat, it would be possible to add a pet-friendly option in the contract. Additionally, it was mentioned that the financials will be returned as soon as the lease is over. Unfortunately, it has been already a month since I moved out, but I have not received any money.",
        "I am sure that there is some misunderstanding. Could you please clarify what is happening with the return? I am afraid I will have to go to court if the money will not be returned in the near future. Please feel free to contact 43838732202 if you have any information.",
