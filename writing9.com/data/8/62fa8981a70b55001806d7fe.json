        "In recent days and ages, in several nations adult ratio outnumbered the senior citizen proportion.  This development has merit and demerits too. In my opinion,brighter sides outweigh the darker sides.  My indication is elaborated further.",
        "There are a plethora of advantages to having a larger number of adults.The foremost merit is that our future life would be better. This is to state that our youth are termed to be the future of our society. The youth are considered   energetic and innovative people. They use to invent new software and technology which might help to create a digitalised country. For instance, a few years before university students invented a vehicle which can run without  fuel . Therefore few innovations can be carried out by  adults.",
        "Moreover, the dependency ratio might be declining yet individuals can live life freely.  The reason is that with the declining age; older age people may suffer from  chronic illnesses such as osteoarthritis, diabetes mellitus and many more.   This would increase the dependency ratio on younger people because they need assistance from the family member in order to complete the activity of daily living.  To illustrate,  a retired person needs financial and social support from  family members. This might create a burden on the youth's life.",
        "Furthermore, its flipper side cannot be neglected. The utmost drawback is the deprivation of the cultural and religious rules. That is older people are well known for the preservation of customs because the cultural aspect is being incultate from the  ancestors to the recent generation group . Thus,  younger ones would not be able to learn moral values and traditional aspects.",
        "In conclusion, the younger generation ratio outnumbered the older people group. Although, this development has a negative side  my explanation proves that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
