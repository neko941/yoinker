        "In this contemporary epoch, whilst opponents hold the view of studying  food as a subject is a waste of time. proponents and I have a diverse view. Thus, I am of the belief that food curricula are essential because learning how food is cooked can improve our health. In this essay, my contention will be demonstrated.",
        "In the beginning , science, math, and history are important subjects to study. In other words, when students learn these subjects, it will help them shape their future, as these subjects can help them to join a well-known university in case of their academic merits. An eminent example is Egypt where it is a must to study such subjects to help the youth to enter the university of their dreams.Hence, what can be said is that scientific subjects are of a paramount role to undergraduates.",
        "Nevertheless, delving into food science can help some offspring to develop  better health. To clarify, if school's boys and girls dived into how healthy meals are made, this will help them to take care of their health, as not be overweight. For instance, in Egypt, young learners are used to studying how healthy food is made at the age of 8 years old. Additionally, studying the structure of food can help teenagers to develop healthy habits of eating vegetables and fruit that will have a paramount positive impact on their health, as eating greeneries helps in preventing  heart diseases. Therefore, not only does studying is important for early-developing children, but it can also affect their health.",
        "In conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points, it can be reiterated that schools should play their role in giving the children food sessions which will help them to develop a healthy lifestyle. I believe that learning the importance of healthy food is of a great impact on children."
