        "Recently, physical education has been mandatory in many primary, junior high and secondary schools. A lot has been said about its benefit to school children. In this essay, the importance of physical education will be highlighted.",
        "Firstly, physical education is vital because it teaches children how to live healthy lifestyles. The theoretical aspect of physical education emphasizes the activities that are essential for growth and healthy living. These activities include eating healthy foods and getting involved in exercise. The practice also gives students the opportunity to play and compete with their mates. For example, during physical education periods, teachers allow children to wear sports fits, match them to the playground and lead them in aerobics. Some take turns in racing. These activities keep children fit and release the stress of always sitting in the classrooms.",
        "Secondly, physical education helps children discover their talents. Some children may not be good academically but as they involve in physical education, teachers realize their potential and help them work hard in that aspect. This gives them a sense of fulfilment as they know they are doing well in another field. To add up, physical education provides knowledge on the various sports, those that are not popular. For instance, I first heard and learnt to play the sport called rugby in my PE class.",
        "In conclusion, the teaching of physical education should be encouraged. Children should be motivated to participate in the practicals because it is beneficial to their health and as well as their well-being."
