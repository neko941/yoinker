        "Currently, with the escalating perils of environmental issues, a lot of experts in this field are joining together to find out more effective solutions to reduce the population. While raising the price of petrol is a common method applied in many countries, I only partially agree with this policy because along with some positive results bringing to the environment, it may lead to many unforeseen adverse effects, especially on the economy.",
        "On the one hand, increasing the cost of fuels can help the governments limit the demand for buying private vehicles, thus reducing the emission of exhaust fumes- the main contributor to global warming. By this policy, residents not only have to consider the amount they have to spend on a car but also the fuels required to operate it every day. Therefore, they may decide to travel less by their personal car, instead using public transport to communicate which gives them more financial benefits. Second, by putting high costs on patrols, the authorities also stimulate the generation of alternative energy sources which is more environmentally friendly. For instance, when the cost of fuels increases, some car manufacturers such as Vinfast in Vietnam tend to invest more in the development of new models of vehicles running on solar power or electricity.",
        "On the other hand, when the government impose higher taxes on petrol, they accidentally limit the development of the tourism and transport industry. The higher price of fuels may cause the soar in travelling fares including the price of flight or coach tickets. That is the reason residents can be discouraged to travel around. Moreover, shipping companies due to expensive fuels can proactively cut off their supply routes. Consequently, goods may be stagnant and inhabitants may also have to tackle the shortage of necessary products if this issue continually occurs in long term.",
        "In conclusion, from my perspective although rising the cost of fuel could be a welcome measure, the authorities should consider all the aspects of this method before putting it into practice to ensure its advantages to the environment as well as narrow negative effects on the economy."
