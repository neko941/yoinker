        "Dear Raj,",
        "I am so glad to hear about your selection by  Waikato university. I did my bachelor's from here  and  must mention that this is indeed a good place to study. However, I would love to give you some advice on finding good and affordable accommodation near the university area.",
        "During my studies, I was living on karte road which is just 20 minutes distance from the university. I rented a basement  in a residential apartment called Alarake which is one of the affordable and nearby places having all the basic amenities for students compared to others.",
        "I would recommend  that you should look for the house using websites such as khiji.come , this is  safe and trustworthy for finding students' shelter. Moreover, the other option  is the university hostel. You can contact the accommodation cell and ask them if space is available which would be the best option.",
        "In addition, I would like to advise you about possible mistakes your should be taken care not to commit. Firstly, do not choose options such as finding a property  involving the agents as they might charge you high. Secondly, you should go for shared accommodation rather than leaving alone.",
        "I hope my suggestions will benefit you. All the best !",
