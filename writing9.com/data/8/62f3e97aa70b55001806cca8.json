        "The world today uses more renewable energy than ever before since it contributes to the preservation of the environment and is economically sound; however, some argue that green power could undermine the reliability of the global supply as a result of its dependency on climatic and meteorological phenomena. This essay will examine both views, but personally, I strongly advocate the adoption of renewable sources of vitality.",
        "On the one hand, opponents of renews claim that the world could face disruptions to the natural energy source supply should they be fully adopted. This is largely due to the fact that green energy types of machinery currently in use depend on changeable and unpredictable phenomena such as wind, rain and cloud cover. To take the fastest growing sector as an example, solar panels can only be used in the presence of strong and direct sunlight, and although the problem of directness has already been somewhat solved with moving panel arrays, a cloudy few days could still result in a blackout if we depended entirely on solar capacity; something that is unlikely to occur today given current oil stockpiles.",
        "However, fossil fuels are a larger threat to spirit security since they are certainly finite in quantity, whereas renewable toughness is effectively infinite; once the Earth\u2019s oil is depleted, there will be no efficiency security without green stamina machinery. Furthermore, problems of unpredictability can be mitigated by improving battery technologies (to create a larger buffer), building more renewable power generators (to increase supply during ideal conditions) and improving current automation (to increase efficiency), such as in the moving solar panel example. Proponents of renewable, therefore  claim that they are the most economical and sound option.",
        "To conclude, while many may believe that green spirit machinery is a threat to stamina security, the fossil fuels they frequently promote are a greater threat, and renewables are in fact the only sound option, both economically and environmentally."
