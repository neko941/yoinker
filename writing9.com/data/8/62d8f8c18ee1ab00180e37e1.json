        "In recent times, mobile payments have been growing rapidly. Paying for goods and services through mobile phones is becoming popular not only in developed countries but also in many developing countries across the globe. In this essay, I will discuss how cellular phone apps have lots of benefits and I'll also go further to explain the challenges faced by this digital payment.",
        "To begin with, the biggest benefit offered by cellular phone apps is the convenience to pay for anything from anywhere. Furthermore, in this fast-paced world where everybody is struggling to find time, these applications have created an efficient and time-saving way to complete all the necessary payments electronically with just a couple of clicks. Moreover, these applications offer various cashback offers, that help people save a lot of money. For instance, the mobile payment app \"PiggyVest\" has made people's life easier as they not only have great offers but also make it possible to give exact change to the recipient without any hassle.",
        "On the contrary, the most challenge faced by this digital payment is the financial risk involved in the transactions. People have to key in their bank account details or debit card details before initiating any transaction and this is the kind of information hackers and frauds are looking for. Regardless, access to such confidential information can cause severe damage to one's monetary stability. Several instances of fraudulent activities such as; breaches of financial databases of companies are reported in news every day. However, organizations are formulating various strategies such as; incorporating more encryption and antivirus solutions to make their applications robust and thus reduce the risks.",
        "To conclude, the benefits offered by cellular applications certainly outweigh the downsides. With proper surveillance and safety protocol, even their drawbacks can be limited to a great extent."
