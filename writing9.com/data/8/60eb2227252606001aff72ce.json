        "I am writing to ask for your help in the Data Mining conference which is going to be held on the 20th of July in Milad tower.",
        "Hundreds of professional developers from the biggest companies in IT will join our conference in 2 days. At first, it will start with an introduction to basic statistics and data engineering courses on Tuesday. The second day will be just workshops that help them learn and write practical project\u2019s codes in Python.",
        "As you are one of the most powerful persons in the field, I would rather invite you to be with our team at least on the first day by giving a presentation about basic statistics needed for data analysis.",
        "I have to coordinate all teams. Moreover, finding the best key parameter indicators to measure the performances of the attendees with the goal of choosing them for our summer camp is the hardest part. I count on you in that part too.",
        "I am looking forward to your answer. Answering me in 48 hours is critical.",
        "Yours Sincerely,",
