        "Success in any field is very enjoyable, but many people only talk about triumph and do not have specific ideas and words about how to succeed. Some believe that success comes from hard endeavour and perseverance, while others believe that success depends on luck. In this article, I want to talk about these two perspectives.",
        "At first glance, it seems that with effort, you can succeed in anything. This is the opinion of most people; The reason for this is obvious, because someone who makes the most of his time and suffers a lot of hardships deserves victory in order to achieve a positive result that is beneficial to both himself and his community. For example, Mark Zuckerberg, has been able to make great strides in the world of technology and communication in the present century through his hard work and the use of his open and creative mind. Let me state that my view of triumph is closer to this view.",
        "On the other hand, a group of people believe that success can only be achieved through luck. This is true of some people, but few people in the world succeed in this way. However, this view can be a great disappointment, because with this mindset, people who are trying and trying will never succeed. They do not work, and these calls into question the concept of living to achieve dreams. Every year, for example, only one American wins the lottery for $100 million.",
        "As a result, you have to work hard to succeed in any field. Of course, it is also a fact that having luck is a very attractive option that can make any human being reach the peak of progress. It can happen in the life of us, we just have to look at our lives with a positive mind."
