        "One cannot deny that in the fast-paced world, there are numerous options wide open for individuals. Some think that these days people have various possibilities. I am of the opinion that we do have many options in every little thing in life. In the following paragraphs, I will explore the rationale for my viewpoint on the matter.",
        "Regarding those who assume that people have all the alternatives they can choose in numerous things in life, there are many reasons. More specifically, most of the countries in the universe are in constant development. Therefore, in developed regions, there is a continuous production of numerous items in various styles, shapes, tastes, and more. In one instance, when an individual goes to a supermarket to purchase a bar of chocolate, there are several brands to decide on.",
        "Although this situation of having many options may be true for most parts of the world, there are exceptions too. In fact, countries such as Afghanistan are quite strict about company brands that can be imported. For instance, the nation does not have many alternatives for food options because the country regulates the brands that can pass the borders. Hence, merely a handful of alternatives exist like only one brand of pasta and rice.",
        "In summary, I maintain that the majority of people have numerous preferences these days; nevertheless, a minor part of the globe still does not have this. In the future, I sincerely hope that all people to be able to find various options to decide on."
