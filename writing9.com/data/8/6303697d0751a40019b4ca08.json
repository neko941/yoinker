        "In the contemporary era, clothes are one of the essential accessories for determining individuals' first physical impression. In line with this, some public suggest that they can predict each one's tradition and nature by looking at their fashion appearance. Personally, I am against this statement because globalization is proceeding quickly as folk try to follow the latest trend.",
        "To begin with, it is complex to discover individuals' background information and personality according to several points. These days, predominantly, companies and schools offer their staff or students to wear uniforms or specific wearings since by having the same fashion, they would easily feel unity among their employees and pupils with less discrimination due to attire. For example, some private schools provide equal uniforms to reduce judging with stereotypes about ethics and nature linked with fashion. From this, equality of each student leads to friendships to be a stronger bond as they did not decide to become close because of expensive goods which stand out at their level.",
        "Another argument is that universe is altered by having effects of globalism. Due to folk's instinct, they tend to follow the nations' dressing outfits when they travel or migrate to a foreign country. It has been proven that individuals want to be part of the local nation people which assume it is a way to interconnect or one step toward understanding their culture. Furthermore, in the materialized world, it is common to be on track with recent trends. This could affect a person who lives in the modernized world and wishes to wear various cultural clothes every day having fantasy as an individual might feel like becoming ,odd not unique. For example, most Koreans wear trench coats in Autumn when one starts to match their look or short-padding if famous artists utilize one clothes and becomes a topic, they are still eager to purchase in winter even though they feel cold. Therefore, if anyone wants to decide the personality of a woman then cloth would not be considered a crucial factor.",
        "In a nutshell, all the factors mentioned above constitute reasonable grounds why the fashion which they wear cannot distinguish their traditions and nature."
