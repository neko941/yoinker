        "I am writing this letter to bring your attention to a road which has been damaged. My name is Richa Sharma and I live in Subhash Nagar area of your constitution.",
        "My house is located in the centre of the main market of the Subhash Nagar and it is facing Gandhi Road. This road has been damaged during this rainy season as it rained above average this monsoon and multiple pits have been created due to it. It has resulted in an increase in accidents. I have also met with an accident last week as my bike lost its balance and my leg has been fractured.  Additionally, it has caused water-logging in those pits which has increased mosquitos in the area and can invite many diseases in the future.",
        "I would request you to start the repair work of the road at the earliest so that it will help to reduce the accidents.",
        "I hope you will take prompt action on it.",
