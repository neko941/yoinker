        "It is said that newspapers are the best way to get the latest information as it has an upper hand over other forms of broadcasting. I disagree with this statement because, in today's day and age where technology is so rapid and accessible through our mobile phones, newspapers may not be able to get the latest information report in seconds after a headline.",
        "Although, way back in 1970's print media was still preferred by people  and it was the only source of information a mass population can reach. For instance, election results are announced soon as the count of the vote is done, newspapers would newspaper the information 24 hours later, whereas, other forms of media like radio and digital platforms to help spread the news immediately. Hence, print copy would not be not the best way to receive the prime information.",
        "Another illustration, I would like to mention on the recent Covid-19 pandemic the entire nations faced is that on various applications we would receive the number of active or confirmed cases on our mobile phones compared to the print medium. News such as these should be communicated as soon as possible so people are aware of the situation and act accordingly. However, newspapers provide a lot of information on the wellbeing and it touches upon various topics like sports, entertainment, business etc., under one roof. Besides, people who do not prefer other forms can also rely on print communication.",
        "To conclude, others forms of communication are far ahead when compared to newspapers in terms spreading updated status of what's happening around the world. In fact, technology is more advanced than ever today that people receive news in the matter of seconds and tweet or have an opinion about it swiftly. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement given."
