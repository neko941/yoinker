        "It is irrefutable fact that juvenile delinquency has shown an upward trend in recent days. There are enormous factors which are responsible for it, however, according to some psychologists, children who are not getting the desired social and emotional learning from parents and teachers are more prone to this situation. I completely agree with the above notion. This essay will throw light on the reasons for it and its effect on youngsters in the upcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there are various reasons which are responsible for increasing the cases of violent crimes. Primarily, Parents are unable to manage their hectic schedule and they do not spend quality time with their offspring. Furthermore, domestic violence is also the reason why kids are not getting enough mental peace. To exemplify it, a recent survey shows that 85% of offenders stated that emotional support made them commit a crime. Additionally, education provided in schools and colleges is restricted to only physical targets and lacks social learning.",
        "It affects society in a negative way. Firstly, it develops the feeling of loneliness among youngsters and puts their health in a dangerous situation. In other words, people affected by stress and depression are more likely to attempt crimes. For instance, a Lack of societal knowledge means they do not feel any onus towards society and consider themselves alone which encourages more chances of theft and other criminal incidents. Moreover, it also affects their professional life.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that it has been proven as the main reason and put a negative impact on every individual. Thus, I fully agree with the opinion. Lawmakers should enforce stringent laws to prevent these incidents."
