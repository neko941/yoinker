        "I am writing to inform you, unfortunately, the garbage in my alley has not been collected for almost a month, likely they can not see my alley because my alley is very narrow at the end of Janat street, I and many of my neighbours have been informed to the local council several times.",
        "I and my neighbours have decided to arrange a complaint letter because there is a bad smell the whole of my allay and we can not tolerate this smell and this is led to an increasing number of animals such as cat and mouse in my alley also these conditions want to make us unhappy.",
        "I think so for solving this issue the local council should install a badge at the entrance of our alley until the agent can find our alley too easily.",
