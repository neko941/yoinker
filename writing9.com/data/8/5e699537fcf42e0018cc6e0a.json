        "It is undoubtedly true that the numbers of obese people has increased than past when  a very few people suffered with this epidemic. This essay will explain the reasons and describe its impact on a person's health and work performance.",
        "There are enormous causes of  the increase amount of overweight people; however, the most important one is an inactive lifestyle. Nowadays, people totally depend on cars instead of  walking even for shorter distance as well as they may not prefer to do work which demands physical efforts. This result in burning less calories and gaining weight. Moreover, consumption of ready- made has increased. Due to busy schedule, most of people consume processed food, which consists higher fat calories. Consuming higher calories on a regular basis means increasing fat in the body.
