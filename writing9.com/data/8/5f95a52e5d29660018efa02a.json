        "Dear John,",
        "Hope this letter finds you in good health and best of spirits. I am writing this letter to inform you that I can't visit Canada on the 24th of November due to an important occasion with my relatives.",
        "I apologize for not coming on the decided date as I get an invitation to my cousin's brother's wedding. He is my maternal uncle's son and we all have a great bond together. It's essential to attend the event and perform Indian rituals that a brother performs at a brother's wedding. On the 23rd of November, I will leave for Delhi from Chandigarh to attend the lady sangeet, which is in late the evening and, the wedding is on the  24th of November.",
        "Admittedly, I was extremely excited to meet you and have fun with you. Although It takes time but soon, I will reschedule my arrival date and let you know. I am so thrilled to see the serene beauty of Canada. Once again apology for disappointing you.",
        "Regards,",
