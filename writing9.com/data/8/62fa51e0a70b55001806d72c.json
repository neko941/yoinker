I can adapt directly to the environment. Another one is, having too many nephews and nieces way back home, therefore, communication is not an issue. Secondly, I have  experience in volunteering in teaching kids  how to respect old people as well as a proper way to greet them conducted by our local town. Lastly, I believe this is a good chance for me to acquire new skills that I can use later on.",
