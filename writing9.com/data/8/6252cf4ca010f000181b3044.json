        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am Karthi and located in Thudialur. I am writing this letter to let you know that there is an internet connection problem with the broadband modem purchased from your shop  2 weeks before. Considering this pandemic situation my company offered to do it on work from home basis.  I  purchased an internet connection modem from your showroom to support my job. At the time of ,installation it is connected well and worked properly. For the last two ,days it is not connecting properly and there was a very slow  internet connection. Because of ,this I am not able to submit my reports and am not able to attend an online meeting. I have to allocate and summarise my subordinates' workings and finally submit them to management. I suggest you please send your representative to close this issue or replace it as it is covered with a replacement guarantee.",
        "Thanks for your consideration and hope to get an immediate response from your side.",
        "Regards",
