        "I am writing to complain about one of your products in the printing section. Currently, due to the corona virus outbreak, I have been obliged to telecommute. Therefore I took one of the printers, HP Z25, we used to use in the company.",
        "During the last two weeks, I had to print over 200 pages of an annual report, but unfortunately, whenever I print out more than 20 pages it stops working. When it happens, I have to wait for about 10 minutes to let the printer gets cool. Then I take the cartridge out of the machine and shake it for 2 minutes, so that the ink could spread all over the film and lastly clean the film with a piece of cotton.",
        "Sadly, this problem has caused me in constant trouble as the sentences in my printed reports are not legible. That is because the cartridge goes out of ink and a mark of ink appears on all the pages. Sometimes the workload is so much that I barely find some time to recharge the cartridge or inscribe the sentences in longhand.",
        "I would be grateful if you could send a technician to fix my printer up to the enclosed address. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
