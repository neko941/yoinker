        "When creating a new town as a project, it is important to add activities that individuals could enjoy. Some believe that it is important to have a sports complex and different types of parks rather than a shopping complex. In my perspective, although both of the ideas have their own advantages, I believe people will be more excited about the idea of building a complex and playgrounds.",
        "Firstly, most individuals would love to spend their time on a sport which they enjoy, moreover, it is healthy to be physically active as well. For example, having a sports complex with a swimming pool, basketball court, badminton, table tennis and squash would certainly give plenty of options to spend their free time. Nowadays, most people spend hours in a gym, therefore having a fully equipped gym could be a plus point. Likewise, if there are plenty of physical activities available, families will surely spend most of their time within the town.",
        "Secondly, playgrounds  provide the option of doing activities together, for instance, outdoor courts, bicycle tracks and jogging tracks could keep help them to build up their bonds. Furthermore, they could have picnics and relax while reading a book or listening to music. Last but not least, families could use parks to have entertainment activities such as musical shows, plays and dramas. Even if it is during the day or night, a park could be used for many events.",
        "Even though having a complex and recreation grounds could bring certain advantages, they could not provide the facilities with a shopping complex offers. Individuals spend time in a mall, especially when they want to buy something or to grab a meal at the food court. Those we could not count as activities which you might do in your free hours. In addition, most playgrounds have food courts nowadays, and because of that, the time spent in complex shopping malls slowly declining.",
        "In summary, people in this generation prefer to spend most of their time doing an activity with their family, so parks and complexes could be the best options. In my opinion, the advantages of providing a park and sports facilities outweigh the benefits of having shopping centres."
