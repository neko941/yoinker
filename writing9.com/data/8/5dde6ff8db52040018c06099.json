        "It is argued that photographs in news stories on television and newspapers are more efficient than words. I also personally think that pictures attract the people more than words.  I will discuss my opinion in this essay.",
        "To begin with, pictures represent the internal news or information at a glance. After seeing a photograph people eagerly read or watch the news. For instance, I saw a picture on national newspaper such as Prothom Alo about the Math Olympiad. When I saw that photograph, then I realize that this competition would be held recently. After that I read the article until the end. Hence, the pictures give a basic understanding to the reader on a television screen or newspapers.",
        "Furthermore, by adding pictures on television news give a prediction about the news. For example, according to a survey by media association in Bangladesh more than 70 percent people like to watch news including pictures. There are some channels which telecast news with pictures as like Somoy TV which telecast all kinds of news are connected photographs. When a channel represents the new of flood one part of a country they required to display the pictures of the flooding area. Without any photos people do not get to observe the real condition of the places. So, photographs with the news on a television screen encourage the audience to watch the news.",
        "To sum up, including pictures in the news can play a vital role by attracting readers\u2019 attention to a particular topic. The Picture also displays a story vividly and make easier to understand."
