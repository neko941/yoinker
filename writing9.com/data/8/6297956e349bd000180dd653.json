        "More and more parents are struggling with work and family balance. While it is widely claimed that they should resign from their careers to take care of their children, some argue that they can do a full-time job. Both points of view and the reason why I believe that it is okay to have a job will be elaborated on in this essay.",
        "To begin with, it might seem sensible for some to believe that parents have to quit their profession and should focus on their childhood, seeing that they play an essential role in a young's learning in order to develop their skills. Many mothers and fathers, for example, decide to leave their workforce to take homeschooling aiming to build stronger relationships with their children. From this perspective, it is comprehensible why some would argue that leaving a profession is the solution to raising their children.",
        "On the other hand, opponents of this idea might propose that many parents have full-time jobs, while they take care of their children. To put in other words, they aim to get a more decent salary to support their financial family. Take CNN news, for instance; in the digital era, they have been portraying many companies, which are becoming increasingly changing to more flexible working from everywhere. Therefore, a permanent profession can be considered an integral balance in their life.",
        "Personally, I would argue in favour of full-time work, as this can help parents to achieve a balance between family and career. To illustrate, employers should assign a reasonable workload and encourage their staff to spend more time with their family, and they should focus on the effective results and create more opportunities for their staff to achieve management between family and career, like organizing family day events and providing more holidays.",
        "In conclusion, although it is undeniable that parents have a responsibility to take care of their children, I am of the opinion that their professions are also crucial for them to fulfil their children, and lead to manage their working and family appropriately."
