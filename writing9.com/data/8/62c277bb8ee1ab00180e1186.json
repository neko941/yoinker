        "I stayed for three days in  room 305 from 1st July to 3rd July. As we all know, Vancouver experienced unusual extremely hot weather recently. However, the air conditioning was not working in my room. The room temperature stayed around 32 degrees no matter what button I pressed. I called room service, but your employer said they cannot change my room and could not find anyone to repair it at the moment.",
        "In order to make my room cooler, I had to open the fridge all the time and bought many ice cubes and water from the supermarket. At night, I had to sleep on the floor with  ice water to make me feel comfortable.",
        "As a customer, I would like to apply for a refund since the sleeping experience was awful and the employer was not helped. I understand this extreme weather is not predictable, so I suggest that you could hire someone to check the cooling system regularly in order to avoid this situation happening again.",
        "I hope that you will address this concern as soon as possible.",
        "Yours faithfully"
