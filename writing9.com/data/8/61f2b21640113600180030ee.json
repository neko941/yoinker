I am writing to you to bring to your attention the need for a better sporting culture at our Institution. Currently, we have sports clubs limited to only Football & Basketball. However, many students are interested in other activities which our University doesn't offer at present.",

I would love to set aside some time to discuss this with you. Kindly provide me with your availability and I will gladly schedule a slot with your secretary.",
