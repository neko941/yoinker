        "How are you? I hope you\u2019ve been well. Sorry for having been out of touch for a short while. There have been some changes in my life and I wanted to let you know the latest from my side.",
        "The big news is that I have finally changed my job. Do you remember when you were here on holiday, and I always talked about how I hated my boring bank job? Well, it was clear I needed a change. So, finally, I took a part-time advertising course and trained to be a creative designer. Now I\u2019m working full-time in an agency. Each day, I look forward to going to work. My clients come from all over the world and I love working with them.",
        "Aside from that, I also moved to a new apartment near the building where I work. It\u2019s small, but downtown, so I am right in the heart of the city, instead of way out in the suburbs. Suddenly, there are so many fun things to do, in the evenings too. I am a much happier person today because of these recent changes.",
        "So, how about you? I hope you\u2019ll have a chance to visit Australia again soon. In the meantime, please write and let me know what\u2019s new with you.",
