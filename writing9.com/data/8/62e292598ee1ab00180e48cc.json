        "Hello, how are you? I hope you're doing okay and still in good health. Anyway, I'm writing to inform you that I'm going to Australia next month to take a Master's Degree, it's a three-year course with a scholarship program. During my stay there, I'm planning to apply for  a part-time job to sustain my education, my monthly bills and my daily needs. Even though my parents said that they will send money every month, I can't just let them burden themselves for me.",
        "Therefore, I'm asking for your help regarding the matter. It's my first time going to Australia and I don't know where to look for a job eligible for international students. Can you accompany me to look for a part-time job once I've arrived there? You can give me a tour while we're looking, in that way, I'll get familiar with the place and not get lost. I'll also treat you with meals while you help me, that would be my payment for your help.",
