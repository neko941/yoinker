        "These days, it is seen that youth crime is increasing at a faster rate than ever before. Some people believe that it is mainly because of their children's lack of parental supervision. I can only partially agree with this argument because I believe that many other factors contribute to the increased crime rate among youngsters. In the forthcoming paragraph, I shall explain my point of view.",
        "Inadequate knowledge about ethical behaviour or societal rules is the prime reason for young people to commit a crime. The current economic condition of society pushes both parents to pursue professional careers to ensure better life prospects and educational facilities for their children. Thus, parents are left with no time to guide their children about the ethical norms of humanity. Children may spend time watching TV or surfing the internet when left alone. They may also make friends with people outside of their social network. Such friendships can push children into wrongdoing. They may develop bad habits like smoking, drinking, or substance abuse. Since parents are absent most of the day, they mainly remain ignorant of their children's activities until it is too late.",
        "However, the absence of parents is not the only reason for the rise in criminal activity among young people. Youngsters from families where one or both parents are present throughout the day also get into crime. They are misled by several factors, including the violence shown on television and in movies. Peer pressure is another factor that leads juveniles astray. Poverty and lack of educational opportunities are all factors that encourage criminal activity among young people.",
        "In conclusion, I firmly believe that inadequate parental guidance is only one of the reasons for crime among young people. Exposure to violence, growing consumerism, and peer pressure also encourage many juveniles to commit illegal or unethical acts."
