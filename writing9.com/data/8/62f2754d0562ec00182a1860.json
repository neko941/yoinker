        "Many individuals believe that adolescence is the pest period of most people's lives. While others hold the opinion that as we grow older, we can enjoy the best things of life, despite taking greater responsibility. Although there is some truth in the latter view, I opine that teenagers enjoy their lives more than adults.",
        "On the one hand, it is justifiable why some people subscribe to the view that by growing older,  life is enjoyable. Firstly, when we grow older, there is no age restriction. When people grow up, they can try and experience anything they want. For instance, when people turn 18 in my country, they can smoke and drink beer. Secondly, as growing older, people can use their money for anything they want. When they were young, they were not allowed to afford what they wanted. By making money by themselves, they can decide how to use the money. They can splurge on extravagant items such as Gucci, for instance.",
        "On the other hand, there are some points why I am convinced that the teenage years are the best time. First, at that age, kids do not have to worry about financial issues, this is one of the most important things why they enjoy living so much as there is nothing to worry about. For example, as there is nothing to care about , immature people can spend their time in their favourite way.",
        "All things considered, both sides have their benefits and drawbacks, I advise that teenagers should use their precious time to enjoy their lives because growing older means that they have to take more responsibility."
