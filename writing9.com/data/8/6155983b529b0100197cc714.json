        "There is a controversial perspective heating a debate over the development in the economy may not fulfill dwellers in a prospering nation. While this statement is valid to some extent, I personally consider myself an opponent to this notion. This essay is dedicated to analyzing the underlying roots of this perception.",
        "It is irrefutable to note that as for many countries nowadays, education still serves as a backbone industry that is the main determinant for the prosperity of one nation. Were the citizens not to have these high-standard aspects guaranteed, their employability might be impaired. Hence, it may act as a disturbance in the social life for not only reduce the formation of skilled workers but also pose a threat to the financial background. Therefore, since knowledge must be ensured in every aspect of people\u2019s life, Government coffers should be invested relentlessly in order to maintain the wealth of one nation.",
        "While the importance of education towards a fortunate nation is widely acknowledged, it is unfair if those of healthcare are being overlooked since this aspect also plays a paramount significant role in social life. In the current stage of time, there are a wealth of diseases that tremendously harm the residents\u2019 condition all over the world. For instance, Covid-19 has become the most unease problem nowadays for causing a high death rate all over the world as well as bringing down the economic sectors of many countries, including well-known prosperous nations such as America or Russia. As a consequence, the rulers bear the responsibility to invest a part of the source to address this dire issue with a view to recovering the economic background. For those reasons, the developments in the health sector are crucial for every country, let alone the thriving one.",
        "In conclusion, I am well convinced that there are far more aspects that need to improve day by day since problems still linger in daily life and there is no exception."
