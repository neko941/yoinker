        "Job selection is an important decision that we all make in our lives. Some people think that the amount of the salary offered to them is the key factor in choosing a job. Personally, although I accept that money is an essential factor in deciding on a career, I believe that other considerations are also equally important.",
        "On the one hand, I agree that money is necessary in order for people to meet their basic needs.  We all need money to pay for housing, food, bills, health care, and education. Most people consider it a priority to at least earn a salary that allows them to cover these needs and have a reasonable quality of life. If people chose their jobs based on enjoyment or other non-financial factors, they might find it difficult to support themselves. Artists and musicians, for instance, are known for choosing a career path that they love, yet most of them struggle financially.  So, it is clear that we should think about the financial aspect of a job before choosing it.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that other factors are just as important as salary. One such factor in choosing a job is personal relationships at work. This is because people spend a great deal of time with their colleagues on a daily basis, so the way people are treated at work has a considerable impact on their well-being.  Having a friendly and supportive manager or boss, for example, can make a huge difference to workers\u2019 levels of happiness and general quality of life. Another factor is career advancement. Many job candidates care more about the possible professional achievements, the skills they could learn, and the position they could reach, rather than the money offered to them. To illustrate, someone dreaming of becoming an editor-in-chief normally has to start working as a reporter with a lower salary.For this person, salary may not be definitely not the most important issue.",
        "In conclusion, while salaries certainly affect people\u2019s choice of profession, I do not believe that money outweighs all other motivators. I would therefore recommend that every individual should ponder all aspects of the job they want to apply for."
