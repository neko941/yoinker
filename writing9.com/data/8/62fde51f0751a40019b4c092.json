        "As technology advances, some argue that teaching the youth handwriting is redundant and unbeneficial. I, however, disagree with this notion and believe that handwriting beneficially impacts children and should be kept teaching at school.",
        "To begin with, the primary merit of handwriting is helping with the learning process. Writing the words on paper allows children to recollect the lecture materials longer than when they type words on their electronic devices. Indeed, many students have expressed that it is more difficult to memorise and review electronic notes after school compared to paper ones for instance. Therefore, their learning comprehension will suffer in the long run if they only take notes on technologies. For that reason, despite typing being more convenient, handwriting still plays a vital role in terms of cognitive ability in the educational environment.",
        "In addition to the above-mentioned advantage, there are other merits associated with taking notes with pen and paper. Firstly, handwriting is linked with the personality and identity of the youth, while typing lacks this. Everyone's handwriting is unique, and by ameliorating it, the youth's characteristics will be better shaped simultaneously for instance. In addition, handwriting alleviates the need for young children to interact with technologies from an early age for taking notes. The use of electronic devices both at school and at home may harm their sightseeing, and so writing on paper is a solution for their sensitive eyes.",
        "In conclusion, with the aforementioned, I deem that teaching handwriting at schools is vital and beneficial for young generations and should be continually encouraged."
