        "If asked whether people should switch jobs regularly or stay with one occupation, many would struggle to make the final choice. Personally, while job hopping has its own benefits, I maintain that people archive a greater sense of fulfilment when they settle down with a stable job.",
        "On the one hand, those who switch career paths regularly may experience some wonders. The first reason is job hoppers have the chance to try their hands at different fields and thus acquire more skills. By switching from one job to another, they can enrich their knowledge and receive recognition for their capabilities. In addition, job hoppers have the opportunity to find what suits them best. As a matter of fact, some people dislike the idea of staying in a particular job for a long time so they need to change jobs more regularly to stay satisfied.",
        "On the other hand, choosing a job earlier on and keeping it would provide people greater satisfaction. Firstly, people would benefit from better job prospects, which include promotion opportunities and earning a more lucrative living. In fact, staying with the same job for a long period of time may allow someone to advance to the top of their chosen field because they have much experience. Besides, people remaining on a particular career path may have can get on well with others working in the same fields, which may be helpful for them to achieve work-life balance.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that although job hopping has its own benefits, choosing a career earlier and remaining it for entire life is more likely to bring greater job fulfilment."
