        "Dear Sir/Maam,",
        "I am writing this letter in regards to your latest edition of Travel Magazine that was released in the market recently. I have always liked to travel to other places since I was young. It amazes me how beautiful a place can be and it made me want for more. Being an avid reader of Travel Magazine, I use it as a reference to the places that are worth visiting. As always, you never failed to impress me, I like how you are detailed about a place you visited. the tourist spots, cuisine and staycation are spot-on. However, there is one tiny problem, you are too focused on the asset of the area, but with little information about its handicap. As I have been following your work for years, it would be great if you also add in your magazine the cons of visiting a place, for instance, how secure it is, the prices and transport. That way, people will be aware and prepare if they plan to visit.",
