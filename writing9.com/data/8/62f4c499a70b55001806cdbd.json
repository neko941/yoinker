        "Morning time is when the family start their day in a positive mood. It is also the time that children like to watch shows on tv. Shows like action, murder and violence are not supposed to be aired in the morning. Seeing that kind of program will not only give a gloomy and negative vibe to adults but also give ideas to children that might cause them harm in the future. If possible, I would like you to replace it with educational and entertaining. For instance, shows about agriculture, cartoons and inspiration, are the kind of shows that will give positive vibes and learning to the viewers.",
