        "Dear Niyi,",
        "You must be really excited about moving to Sydney. How are all the preparations going? In your letter, you ask if I\u2019ve got any advice on how to improve your English before you leave. Well, I\u2019ve given it some thought and here are a few ideas you can work with.",
        "Speaking is probably going to be the most useful, so if I were you, I\u2019d try and speak in English as much as possible. If you have time, I think you should do a short, intensive oral course before you go as this will help improve your speaking skills. I wouldn\u2019t recommend you buy one of those language courses on CD though, because they are really expensive, and you don\u2019t get the opportunity to interact with other people.",
        "As for your listening skills, you should tune in to English language programmes on television and radio whenever you can. Also, don\u2019t forget that lots of Australian, British and American websites have audio that you can listen to and practice with, so I\u2019d make the most of the internet if I were you.",
        "Browsing the internet will also help extend your vocabulary, but you ought to read books, magazines and newspapers as well. You\u2019d better get a good English dictionary too. I don\u2019t think you should discard your bilingual one, only use it when you must.",
        "Well, I have to get back to work now. If you need any more information, don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch.",
