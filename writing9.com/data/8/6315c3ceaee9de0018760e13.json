        "As I told you before, my previous work environment was pretty much toxic as well as always very hectic. In addition, there was too much politics in the workplace and the pay wasn't good too. Therefore, I applied for a job at a new company that was looking for people enthusiastic about taking on challenges and  interested in new technologies.",
        "Well, in this new job, the working atmosphere is very healthy and gives work-life balance too. Because of that, now I can upgrade myself well with the latest state-of-the-art technologies. Moreover, I am earning at least two professional certifications in the past 3 months. The pay is also good, and they offer performance bonuses, and I would be able to travel to different places and explore many places!",
        "The other good news is that I bought a two-story landed house with a small garden. I am planting so many flowers in my garden so you know I can wake up now with the smell of fresh flowers every day. Anyway, I nearly forgot to remind you that my upcoming birthday is next month. I will see you and your family  soon.",
