        "It\u2019s often said that it\u2019s beneficial for children to participate in organized group activities during their free time. However, many arguments are made against this view. Personally, I think that it\u2019s better for children to hang out with others than staying on their own.",
        "In the one hand, those who support this opinion say that taking part in organized group activities make children more sociable than others  and integrate easily in different societies in the future. Because the interaction with others is the best way to develop their communication skills and awareness of others. For example, a kid who practices theatre  feels more confident and can express his self easily in front of a public, also the one who plays football knows the role of the team to success. one other argument is that the difficulties faced by children make them stronger, besides help them to grow as a person through those bittersweet experiences.",
        "By contrast, the opponents of this point of view argue that it\u2019s better for children to learn how to spend their free time apart from those groups, because of the problems they can face, many parents have been suffering from frustration of their children after a bad experience with their mates, which turns to a real complex and isolation from others. For instance,many studies proved that verbal and physical bullying is Omnipresent in those spaces. Moreover,the integration of these groups creates a kind of stress for children  because they should strike a balance between their studies and the required performance of the activity they are practising, which is not easy.",
        "To conclude, it seems quite hard for parents to decide whether to enrol their child in a group, is a good or a bad idea. Some cite the disadvantages of these activities on the behaviour and development of our children, others mention the advantages, personally, I totally agree with the last opinion, despite the challenges parent should encourage their progenitors to interact with society instead of isolating them."
