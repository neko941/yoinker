        "Although shopping was too monotonous event in our lives,  it has been a great distraction in the current lifestyle of stress working environment, yet for me it is an amazing relaxation. There are a huge number of possible ways to undertake this task and difficulty is to choose the most favourable one.",
        "Generally, the pace of our lives has increased significantly in the past two decades and getting time for shopping has eventually reduced. However, given the fact new technology has given us an access to the entire world of shopping at our fingertips. These online tools have helped us buy what we want at a click of a button as well as keep us glued to one shop with offers as we use to do it in the old days.",
        "People today have a great tool and platforms to shop than ever before, like buying clothes, booking tickets, groceries etc., is very convenient. On the contrary the online shopping has also become an addict and people are becoming lazy. All the new offers keep them glued with one app and that doesn't give the shopper an option to move to next as it is going to start from the scratch all over again. Hence, it is more of a disease if not controlled beyond the shopping for requirements.",
        "In conclusion, the shopaholics are suppose to be responsible in understanding the demand versus supply of their needs and wants theory. Finally, I prefer to spend most of my leisure time with my family and friends to ensure my free time is utilized efficiently. The society should take the advantage of the technology while shopping and simultaneously is the responsible person in their family."
