Having to say, I am an executive manager of a company and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I should work from home regularly. Not to mention, I have had a number of the meeting taking place on Skype or Zoom platforms, but yesterday the screen light of the laptop has gone blurred.",

Therefore, I have no choice but request you to replace my laptop with a new one as soon as possible. I would appreciate it if an IT expert takes a look at the setup software, as well.",
