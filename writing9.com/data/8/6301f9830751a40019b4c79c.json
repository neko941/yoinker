        "Dear editor,",
        "I am writing to express my deepest concerns in regard to the recent news about the selling of the \"New Hampton\" park, located at the intersection of Avalon Avenue and Thomas Street. My name is Laura Espeso, I was born and raised in this neighbourhood and my family has been residing in the area since 1945. As a proud local, and a responsible neighbour, I feel it is my duty to report such a catastrophe.",
        "The \"New Hampton\" park was designed and built in the 1950s as an honourable memorial dedicated to the fallen of our city's historical civil war. It was my grandfather who bravely participated in that war and therefore I consider it would be an insult to his memory to sell such an important monument in this city.",
        "I politely ask the editor of this important newspaper to please print this urgent message in the community's section to make everyone aware of the local council's plan. Otherwise, I will have to present my case in the next town hall meeting, as it would be absolutely detrimental to our community's cultural background to letting this happen.",
        "Hope to hear from you soon,",
        "Yours sincerely,",
