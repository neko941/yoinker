        "schools  shape  the uncut diamonds into a righter one.Many suggest that 14 is righteous  for leaving schools , however, I readily believe that institutional education is crucial until 18. My  essay will analyze both viewpoints along with suitable examples.",
        "To commence, school staff is certainly responsible for shaping the personality of mortals physically as well as emotionally. Therefore, until 14 there is feeble nourishment of a teenager to face the world or to socialize in the society. For instance,there are umpteen cases  when young denizens are violated and harshly treated by some obnoxious persons.Thus, until the age of adolescence ultimate guidance of pedagogues is quite vital for the proper growth of lads in every aspect.Subsequently,teachings till 18 are a basic necessity for proper know-how of the world.",
        "on contrary, the contemporary era demands quicker results despite any moral development. To elaborate, it is convicted by many that, acquiring a sound basic academics in enough to suffice furthur needs of young teens and gaining a specific knowledge about a particular subject , that is influencing their future aims, would be more appropriate.To exemplify, the few millionaires individuals in the society with less schooling and most of them are college dropouts are acting as stardom for kids to prevail at a young age without any proper learning age. Anyways,they should be taught that everyone succeeds according to there respective time and fortune as well.Moreover, they will encounter the best part of there life at schools only which ultimately will help them to become a proper human, with the right understandings with outstanding achievements.",
        "To summarize, although the people suggest that studying in educational centres is unnecessary after 14 but I believe that having this firms for 18 years of youth is really crucial for a promising future and worthy life"
