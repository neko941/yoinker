        "In the current world, pictures are becoming a more vital medium of interaction instead of text.I totally agree with this view because citizens dislike reading written materials and  easy  understanding.The essay will explain in detail the reasons for my stance as well as examples in the subsequent paragraphs.",
        "To begin with ,the primary factor portrait is significant means of communication that is simple to interpret.It is easy to understand photos rather than text because written words are ambiguous.For instance,when someone writes kick the bucket,a  lot of inhabitants will not understand the meaning because it has a literal understanding.Although artists will benefit , students will suffer.While it is simple to know the meaning of a portrait of people wearing black which means they are mourning their loved ones or someone is dead.Therefore ,people admire communicating with pictures because of simple understanding.",
        "Secondly,another reason pictures are a crucial  form of communication nowadays is the majority of citizens do not like reading.People are more inclined to read images  rather than written words.In ,addition movies are a better way to send messages across the globe because reading a text is boring to a lot of the public.For ,example majority of the public fails to read instructions on the street compared to photos.Moreover, it serves as of form of advertisement.Companies are using pictures to advertise so that their customers will get the meaning fast.Most billboards and flyers are easy to understand because of the images on them which serve as a form of promotion to companies.",
        "In conclusion,the dislike for reading passages by inhabitants and easy interpretation are the two reasons for the popularity of photographs and films as a current mode of interaction."
