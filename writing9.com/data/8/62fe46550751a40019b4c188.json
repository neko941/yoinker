        "In recent years, people have the tendency to use disposable things such as plastic bags and tableware, while there has been much debate on this issue. This essay is going to discuss the main causes and potential problems of it.",
        "For one thing, the reason why people love to use disposable items is that it is more convenient than reusable ones, people do not need to wash them after finishing the meal, they can directly throw them away. For another thing, people now have an incline to dine out rather than cook at home, so using disposable spoons and chopsticks becomes a ubiquitous situation. For the last thing, in order to meet the customers' dining preferences, restaurants have no choice but to offer them disposable tableware, because it can not only reduce the cost but also provide customers with what they want.",
        "Nonetheless, it will contribute to some detrimental effects on the environment. For example, using plastic bags will lead to a lot of inimical impacts, because they are difficult to be decomposed by nature, we have no choice but to burn them down; however, they will produce an abundance of harmful substances during this process. Furthermore, some people will throw these things randomly and might be accidentally eaten by wild animals. Take turtles for instance. Some people will throw the straws into the ocean after finishing their drinks, if these straws are digested by turtles or other sea creatures, it might cause a natural disaster.",
        "In conclusion, although using disposable things seems really convenient in our lives, it certainly contributes to a variety of detrimental impacts. The government should introduce legislation to reduce the threats of these disposable things."
