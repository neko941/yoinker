        "Nowadays a certain section of people believes that residing in the urban area is better, whilst others would rather live in the countryside. In this context I will describe the pros and cons of living in the city and summarise my opinion.",
        "First of foremost, taking the benefits into consideration of residing in the city, it offers convenience to the resident as everyone in the modern day spends a busy life. In Sri Lanka the commercial area is situated in the city, where it is easier for the public to commute from their residence to the workplace. Moreover, access to the shopping malls, international food chain outlets, movie theatres and other government authorities, whilst the benefit of living in the countryside offers a calm and relaxation to your mind and soul as it is less crowded as the occupant does not spend a busy life ,unlike the living in the city. For example, in Sri Lanka shopping malls are located in the urban area, as  many residents such as youngsters, and families spend their weekends or weekdays after work at the mall thus they hover around, and everything is available under one roof.",
        "Besides  the benefits, there are drawbacks to living in the city as well. To elaborate more, one of the predominant rationales is traffic congestion where there is air and sound pollution, in comparison to the countryside. To illustrate further on this   in Sri Lanka approximately 80% of traffic congestion in the city than in the countryside.",
        "In conclusion, in my point of ,view as everyone in this day and age spend a busy life ,therefore, they choose convenient to live in the city rather than residing in the countryside, regardless of the environmental pollution, as the core advantage is convenience."
