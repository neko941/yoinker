        "I am Anna Lu, a senior back-end developer from the IT department. This is my third year at Google. I am writing this letter to request a one-month leave due to illness.",
        "I noticed pain occurred around my right shoulder and backbone last month. Because of the heavy workload, I have not got a chance to relax and do some treatment for the pain. As a result, I feel serious headaches when sitting up in front of a computer. This really disturbs me as I found it hard to focus on my tasks. I went to see a physiotherapist last weekend, and he suggest me relax my body and training is needed for the following month.",
        "As we completed the last milestone ahead of our schedule, I do not have too many tickets with me for the next two weeks. My leader would take over all of the pending tickets from me. I would start picking up some urgent tasks in the third week and my colleague, Andy, is willing to help with other requests.",
