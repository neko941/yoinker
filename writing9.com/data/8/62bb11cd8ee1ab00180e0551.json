        "In the modern era of times, people prefer to take shortcuts not only to meet career goals but also to attain success in their personal life. It is thought that taking risks is crucial for people both in their professions and personal life. In this essay, I will discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of such activities and will provide an overall opinion.",
        "Are there myriads of benefits of undertaking dangers in both personal and professional aspects of life? Certainly, there are. First and foremost, it saves a lot of time in meeting a professional goal. That is to say, sometimes a corporate person can commit unethical activities, for instance, lobbying, donation, and so many others for getting a promotion. Secondly, putting things down under a threat can more often than not yield more money in personal life. I mean instead of making safe investments, for example, fixed deposits, real estate, and many more, one can earn more profit by buying stocks even though it does not ensure a guaranteed benefit.",
        "Turning to the other side of the argument, it is thought that by developing a mindset of taking risks, people become less efficient and idle. When it comes to the question of bribing others for promotional purposes, people become inefficient. In this way, it demotivates one to learn how to manage things, such as project work, balancing budgets, etc. In addition to these, people become reluctant to be hard-working in their personal life. That means they like to earn a hefty amount of money by doing illegal activities, say, smuggling, casinos, and many other risky sports.",
        "To summarize, it must be said that taking risks in both personal and professional lives can bring more money as well as it can save a lot of time even though it affects the mindset of people. I reckon the virtues of putting things down on the board exceed the demerits."
