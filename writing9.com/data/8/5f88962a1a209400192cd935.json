        "Without shallow for  doubt that teenage years are one of the important parts of every person. Some people think that   conflicts between parents and youngster is valid for the growing process, while others think that family should avoid that problem. From my point of view, that essential stage of minor's development has negative and positive sides.",
        "On the one hand, I think that  an argument between the perspectives of adults and teenager, will help  to mature. Reason for that is disagreement forces to  form and advocate own opinion. For instance, a child may grow up in a family of meat-eaters but feel very strongly about not eating meat. If this child does not voice their opinion, they will be going against their principles.",
        "On the other hand, teenage conflict is harmful , it can damage relationships between parents and their children. This is because such disputes can create tension in the family. For example, it is quite common for young people to begin smoking, at their age to impress but the resulting conversation with parents can appear difficulties with communication in the future. In contrast, if there is no misunderstanding between parents and teenagers, there will be a much greater sense of happiness among family members.",
        "In conclusion, despite the danger of damaging relationships which teenage conflict can create, it is my firm belief that this time of friction is a vital step on the path to teenagers becoming mature and independently-minded adults.hence, I recompete to parents be more understanding."
