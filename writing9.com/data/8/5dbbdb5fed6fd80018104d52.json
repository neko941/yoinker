Also, they will come to know about interacting with different kinds of people to full-fill their requirements. In addition to that, one can make good other student friends at work, thus they can help each other in their tasks and studies.",
        "When it comes to corns, the Utilization of money that students will get from work can lead them to addicted to bad habits such as drinking alcohol, smoking, drugs and hanging out with friends for overnight parties. Parents may not be able to monitor the moments of their children due to their busy schedules.
