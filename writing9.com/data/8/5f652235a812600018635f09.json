        "Certain people believe that working within a group would give more value and provide more ideas and would improve the project to reach a higher level, rather than working alone without others' help. This essay will discuss both sides in details and will outline my point of view.",
        "Firstly, people who prefer working in groups will be more energetic, creative, sharing ideas and material between others, looking to present the best of their beliefs, cooperate together in order to reach a higher level of ability. for example, some teachers oblige students to work in groups to present projects,  we would see them on a round table speaking, sharing, discussing info, how to present, what to write etc... Such orientation may lead to improve the proficiency of schooler and expanding the learning between them.",
        "On the other hand, schoolers who prefer doing projects alone, are non-speakers, does not share know-how with others, work independently without help. Besides, some of these students could be remarkable, as they prefer not to be interrupted by others, they focus more on finalizing work alone and may reach higher marks. for example, these days, due to the current situation, all students are studying through the internet, and projects are completed by the student himself, no walk-in meetings, hence, this condition gave a lot of time for thinking, preparing and analysing the task.",
        "As a conclusion and to present my point of view, working in a group or doing projects alone are both accepted for students, especially, in future, these students would depend on themselves to make decisions, and also they will be able to deal with others in life, and accordingly,contributing in both types of projects are important."
