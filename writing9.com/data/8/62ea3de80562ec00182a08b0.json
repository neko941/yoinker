        "I know this job is for me, I got the skills they need, and I think I fit with the culture they have. Thus, in preparation, I am reviewing all the things you have taught me, and I am also learning the new technologies that they are currently using.",
        "If you need any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at 080-1234-1234 or [email\u00a0protected]",
