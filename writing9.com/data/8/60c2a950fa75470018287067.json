        "Education is the most pivotal factor in this neoteric era while few adolescents believe that machines and robotic study play a part and parcel role instead of reading about the past time. so in this essay before making a final note subsequent paragraph would shed lights on both points of views.",
        "To commence with the first school of thought, When it comes  to why individuals think that antiquity subject is available  in the school curriculum. The prime view is that  at the present day mortals are attracted by the  advancement of technology. And they also forget their traditions and customs. In addition to it, with the help of past syllabus juveniles can boost up their knowledge moreover, They know about their ancestors, traditions, cultures, weapons as well as living standard of past era masses. For instance, most of the engineers still took help from the old methods or studies to buildup new things or modify new things.",
        "On the other side, another school of thought does not believe in the past study because they think according to the fascinating lifestyle. Firstly, a Mechanical person  is very beneficial  in  extreme conditions where humans are helpless. Artificial machines not only work on difficult tasks  but also do work in household chores such as cleaning, mopping and so on. For Example, in natural disasters where humans cannot give help. At those ,stages bionic people do work with the help of folks. In spite of this, folks are fully aware of the situations by weather forecasting this is possible only with the cooperation of technique and technology. Last but not least, If human beings use more and more machinery then they will save their energy and age.",
        "In conclusion, once again, I would like to reiterate that  skill and automation academics are very essential  for the overall development of individuals. According to ,  multitudes had better-prepared technique subjects as compared to the past.The sooner the people understand the pros of technology,  is better for them. Hammering to the last nail, I would like to say all fingers of our hands are not the same in the same way all people have distinct mindsets and it's their personal interest and choices by which they can select their career."
