        "For the last 2 months, I am staying in Room no 1004 and sharing a room with John Gendo , a student in the Arts department. Since starting he invited his friends to a room for parties and annoyed the whole hostel by making loud noise but this time he has crossed the line. Last night, numerous friends of his came to the hostel room to celebrate his birthday and all of them were drunk. Not only they were screaming loudly but dancing vulgarly also. Politely, I asked him to stop this and raised my concern that exams are coming and Noise made by his groups impacting my study but he did not bother.",
        "Not only this, but he also talked to me rudely on that day and was not ready to stop that. For a long time I was thinking of complaining to you but this time  I could not stop myself as my study is impacting that will create obstacles in my future so It would be helpful either if you Warn him or allot me some another room.",
        "Hope you will understand my situation and take swift and prompt action against him.",
