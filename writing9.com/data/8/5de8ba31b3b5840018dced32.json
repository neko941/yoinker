        "Being a regular customer of your company, I ordered a pair of Gucci Black Leather Jackets. One for me and another for my wife. Although I got the parcel within two days as per your policy, when I opened it after signing your acknowledge form, I found only one jacket. It is unacceptable, and I am extremely disappointed with your services.",
        "As you already know, it has been extremely cold in Sydney due to the sudden change in weather. Actually, my wife is more vulnerable to fever and flu, particularly in winters. Since she is a working woman, she needs to wear a warm upper to go outside as without it she would certainly get sick.",
        "I would like you to send another piece of a jacket on an urgent basis. If you are out of stock, please send me a full refund through courier not later than tomorrow so that I can order from other websites.",
        "I look forward to hearing back from you immediately.",
