        "Basically, there are a couple of issues here. First, the workers do not take a break at the weekend. During the working days I am at the office and I do not have any complaints, but I am not able to have a good rest because of the noise on Saturday and Sunday. Second, sometimes the roaring of construction machines is unbearable. I suppose they are quite old and that is why their sound is so ear-splitting.",
        "Taking all of these into account, my suggestions are to stop any work at the weekend and to repair or change the machines that are being used on my street. These two measures would make my life a bit easier.",
        "Please let me know if my proposals can be implemented.",
        "Best regards,",
