        "Gender equality plays a vital role in the development of the country. In this context, universities should admit equal numbers of males and females in every subject. This essay will discuss why I completely agree with this notion because education is the right of every gender.",
        "The main reason why universities should accept the equal number of both gender is that every field of education wants equal numbers of males and females. They are most important for the progress of the country. For example, there are multiple companies in which both genders play an important role. Moreover, males and females have different thinking  minds which is very beneficial for the progress of industries. As a result, they work together and share their ideas with each other. So, they are played a vital role in the advancement of the country and positive attitude towards their work.",
        "A secondary reason why university gives equal opportunity to both males and females education is also the most important factor. For instance, female education teaches their children in the future and they will also teach other students like mothers. Therefore, students will be interested in their education and grow in every field of life. So, female education is of equal importance to male. The female teacher will be taught their student with love.",
        "In conclusion, this essay discussed why the educational system should give equal importance to both genders because both are very important for the development of the nation. In my opinion, I completely agree with the proposition that gender discrimination is bad for the country."
