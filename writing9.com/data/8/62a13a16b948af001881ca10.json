        "Some individuals feel that  professional sports people can behave as they please on or off the fields as long they are decent players. In this essay, I will share my own opinion on why I disagree with this statement.",
        "First of all, letting these sports people act as they want could have serious damage to their image as a player. If they chose to behave differently everyone would not respect them due to the lack of consistency. It will not be very beneficial for their career and fans will be disappointed. For example, when the famous tennis player Novak Jokovic chose not to congratulate the winner who won  the match he played, it had a negative impact on his famous and personal image. Moreover, some people felt that he was an entitled human being,which also led to where a lot of viewers did not focus on how good or bad Novak played that game.",
        "In addition, sports players need to be aware they are the role models for  a lot of children who are watching them. If they  chose to treat people bad on or off the field, that behaviour would be witnessed by these kids and could potentially influence them  showing them that it is okay to behave inconsistently  towards some people.For instance, when I grew up, I always watched Zlatan Ibrahimovic who is a famous soccer player. He would always act a bit like a diva in front of the cameras, but off-camera, he always treated other players and fans with respect.  It has had a positive impact on me growing up. This has led me to be humble no matter what awards  I get from doing something right or better than others.",
        "In conclusion, there are some folks that feel that females and males that are playing different sports can act like they please on or off the fields, but there will also have a large impact on the people that are viewing them. In saying this,  I disagree with the statement  above  since it is important that these players act in a good manner and treat everyone around them decently in the game and out of it."
