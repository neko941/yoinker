I think it will take me a long time, so I cannot catch up with the movie schedule for sure, but I have a friend that interested in this movie. His name is Tim who he is our classmate. I believe you  met him before in  class. If you do not mind, I will ask him to go with you instead of me. Tim is a hilarious person that I have known, and I hope both of you can be  good friends in future. Moreover, Tim also has a car, so he can pick you up at your house.",
