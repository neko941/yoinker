        "In the modern day, there has been a lot of change in our way of life and these changes affect the most to school life of many students. For this problem, I will discuss with you the two sides that apply advantages and disadvantages to the situation.",
        "This change has benefited the student in a lot of ways. For example, students can have their own free time and can do so much stuff and work with these times. Secondly, a student can relax their brain function in study, in lectures, future life. Thirdly, a student can have the freedom from being told to study a lesson that they have a deep-seated for, thus, the student can enjoy more of their time for activity. Like, spreading out the newspaper, a discussion with a friendly classmate, or researching an unknown thing.",
        "Apart from that, there are some stuff drawbacks to students in their future careers. Like, if their children want to study another section and they don't have with them the simple knowledge of science it leads to the conclusion that they have to study all over again. Next, many jobs have required people with a memory of all basic knowledge about everything can have a better chance to find a job. Finally, the students can have a selection of many different types of schools without worrying about whether being selected or not.",
        "In summary, I mostly agree that students should learn science subjects in school in many countries. The main reason for this is that we do need the knowledge of science to straighten and tighten our path to a bright future."
