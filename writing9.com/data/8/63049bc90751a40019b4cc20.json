        "I am Supun who lives on the 2nd cross street, and I have been living here for 10 years now. I am writing this to bring your attention to a noise disturbance that I am experiencing in my quite calm neighbourhood.",
        "To begin with, let me explain the nature of this problem. Starting from last week, there are some modifications going on the pavements of the street. The workers use heavy machinery to dig the holes in the pavements, and it is too much noise which is hard to bare. We complained several times to the community hall, but there was no  response, as a result of this behaviour I thought in write to you.",
        "As a solution for this issue, I suggest arranging this work only in the daytime, because most of us are working at that period of the day, we may not feel any disturbance.",
        "I would appreciate your immediate attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
