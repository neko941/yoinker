        "As we all know, living in a foreign country and dealing with new people is not plain sailing. Surviving in a place where a different language is spoken will not be easy even if you are fluent in that language. So, I agree that one has to face so many social problems as well as practical problems. In this essay, I will dig into some of the issues why it is not that simple to live in a foreign country.",
        "The very first thing one has to encounter is the language barrier. The different dialects will surely make you have trouble. Moreover, even buying things from a store will not be easy if you do not understand their accent. Another problem comes from communication with the local dwellers. For example, the local people invite you to a party but you cannot make new friends because of the language barrier while the others are having fun. Also, you will not get a chance to have conversations with your neighbours. Since you live in a new place you need to widen your social circle so you must be fluent in the language of the country that he intends to move to.",
        "In addition, coping with new cultures is another challenging thing. Every country has different religions and manners so we need to struggle a lot to fit in. If we cannot communicate, we will not get the opportunity to learn about their cultures and we will not settle in their community. The consequences of this are loneliness along with no friends and low socializing. For instance, when I travelled to Spain for business even though it was just a week, I felt so alone because I had no one to speak to or hang out with. I cannot imagine myself living there for extra weeks without even knowing a word. These are the detrimental effects of living in a country where you have to speak a foreign language.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, although we can not deny that there are so many problems in migrating to a different country, we can solve these problems with the help of language. Also, as time goes by we will be used to these problems."
