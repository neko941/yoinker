        "The reason behind this letter is due to non-receival of any response from the company. I expect a fair reply from a reputed firm to address the customer complaints within a stipulated time frame as mentioned in your terms and conditions. However, I felt really uncomfortable to travel anymore with your tour taxi.",
        "The incident took place when I asked the driver to drop me a little ahead of my actual destination. Suprinsegly, he demanded an extra fare of Rs. 500 for a little half a kilometre without any justification. This caused to start arguments and resulted in misbehaviour and dropped me in an unknown area with no access to any public transport.",
        "I would like the company to make an immediate note of this driver Mr Kumar with vehicle KL-05 AZ 7366, he should be morally suspended as a misbehaviour punishment. Also, this will make others  comply with the business rules and make the reputation of the company even better.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "James Joseph."
