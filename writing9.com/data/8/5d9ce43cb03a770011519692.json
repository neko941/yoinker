        "System of Formal examination is used by many countries nowadays in order to evaluate their students at the end of every semester.

For instance, as a student, I appreciated knowing whether or not my grasp and understanding of concepts is excellent. It is for these reasons that formal exams are still widely used by schools and universities.",

For example, many students are very keen to give presentations and online quiz to enhance their educational skills as well as their confidence. Therefore, conducting brilliant presentations and seldom held a quiz whether online or written can be used to evaluate the understanding of students.",
