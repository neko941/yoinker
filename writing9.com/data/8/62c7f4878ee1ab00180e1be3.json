        "It's been a while since we have neither spoken nor met with each other. And that's why writing to you to apologize for not being in touch with you. I know I have a few missed calls from you which are still unanswered. And to note, I haven't forgotten the belongings you had left at my house.",
        "For the past two months, I am busy preparing IELTS exam to support my immigration to Canada. That's where the stuff I borrowed from you is useful viz. a headset and a printer. While conducting the Listening test, the \"noise reduction\" featured headset allows me to be in a real-time exam set-up. This is pretty useful to understand the words and score high. Another item from you, a printer, is also proving to be an asset right now. Because I have opted for a paper-pen-based test, the printer at home is quite handy to print  multiple exam papers.",
        "I hope you are not in a need of these two things currently, though I am planning to return them after my test on 23rd July. Let me personally visit you  3 weeks down the line and return your gadgets along with the printer's ink bottles.",
        "Hope to see you soon and once again apologize for not returning your goods which are overdue for a long.",
        "Best regards,",
