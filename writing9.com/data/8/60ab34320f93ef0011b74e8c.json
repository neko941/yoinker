        "In the past few years, both animals and humans are facing a terrible situation. Many animals extinct due to overhunting. On the other hand, an increase in the temperature creates global warming and other environmental condition that affect  people. I partially agree  that money could only spend on society issues. It is the government responsibility to look after the animals.",
        "Many countries are facing problems such as poverty and health care. Both are important for the development of the country. The government used the taxpayer money to improve the medical condition. Proper medical facilities are providing to the locals are the government duty. Next, establishing new industries and other business according to their region is the source of employment. Only that helps to decline poverty. These are two fundamental pillars of the developed countries. Every government should strong these departments for the welfare of society.",
        "However, we could never neglect that we are all is the part of ecosystem. Protect animals are our responsibility not only the government. Spending money on national reservation park is a significant step to protecting those animals who are endangered. The officials are always monitoring  these kinds of animals. Moreover, once a famous scientist Albert Einstien said if all the honey bees are extinct then human spiece only have a few years to live. In addition to this, protecting animals like protect ourselves.",
        "In conclusion, the fundamental issues are needed to be sorted out. Even though, animal rights are also important. If we have to spend money on them then it is not a wastage of money instead it is beneficial for both of us."
