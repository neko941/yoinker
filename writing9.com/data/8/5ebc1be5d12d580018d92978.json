        "Undoubtedly, advertisement has a drastic role on company\u2019s highest sales. It is often argued that advertising is of greater significance, when it comes to majority sales of the company\u2019s goods, even though they are not necessary for community. I fully agree with this view that the advertisement has positive effects on sale. In turn, this essay will discuss the influence of adverts for the high sales of products.",
        "On the other hand, selling products need an arrangement advertising. Investment on advertising not only causes more identification and also arise people\u2019s knowledge about the company\u2019s products, but also it makes that company increases the competitive power with other companies, and try to emit their competitor from production field, so this company becomes lauded as much as others. Hence their products become popular and it causes to arise their sales. For example, MC\u2019DONALD\u2019s company has invested on adverts, so it becomes a famous one with their high sales. I believe that advertising is an important factor for increasing sales in today\u2019s society. To sum up, adverts have a vital effect on the company\u2019s sales.",
        "On the other hand, adverts have an incredible effect on people\u2019s mind. Sometimes advertising defrauds people\u2019s mind, moreover their mind assumes that this new sort of product is bought by him with neither thinking nor investigating about the object. In addition, he does not think whether he needs this good or not. For instance, nowadays actors have advertised different brands of goods, followed by, people who love him start to buying that object, as a result, sales of the product increase. Though always lots of adverts do not meaning of high sales, for some companies use exaggeration in their advertising, and if people probe about that product, they will understand their trick, so they will not buy that project. On the base of my view, advertising can change people\u2019s mind about everything. To take everything into consideration, although some things are not the real needs of the community, an excellent adverting lead to high sales.",
        "In conclusion, it is clear that people and society are affected by adverts to buy some things, even if they are not required. As mentioned in the preceding two paragraph advertisement either get people familiar with products or causes brain accept that project is the best. To have high sale of goods, the advertisement must be organized on the top level."
