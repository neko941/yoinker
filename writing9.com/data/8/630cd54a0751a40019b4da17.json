        "Dear Mrs Barrett,",
        "My name is Alice Sparks and I am writing this letter because I am interested in helping you out at home during the summer. In your advertisement, you mentioned that you were looking for someone who can tend to your backyard and help with the cooking and dishes. I have had part-time jobs before doing both of these activities so I have considerable knowledge and experience that might be useful.",
        "I am currently a student, completing my Bachelors in the university and looking for part-time work for the summer. Your house is only a few blocks away from my place, so commute will also not be an issue. Additionally, I cook and tend to the garden at my home in my leisure time as well, so this is a convenient job for me.",
        "I am also interning with one of my professors during the summer, so I will be unavailable from 11 AM to 4 PM on weekdays. Also, I have Networking classes in the evening on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 6 PM to 7 PM. However, my schedule is free at the weekends.",
        "You can reach me at +91-872600000 and we can discuss this further. Looking forward to hearing from you.",
