        "There is no doubt  that reading is extremely significant  for both entertainment and information. Although it is sometimes thought public libraries  provide  books to satisfy these requirements, some people believe that spending money on these institutions are  purposeless.  In my opinion, I personally consider the opponents' view is true because there may not only have adequate space but  maintaining  can be difficult as well.",
        "Firstly, libraries could not have space to accommodate  different kinds of reading materials for the customers,  due to this,  many people often find the centre  is insufficient to meet their needs. For example, the physical form of books should be placed on proper  shelves, there may not find any locations for rare subjects. As a result, users would prefer alternative sources to collect the materials.",
        "Secondly, the maintaining of these public-funded buildings require a huge amount of fund. Therefore, many opponents point out that instead of this, that fund can be better channelised to much-pressing issues such as constructing hospitals, roadways, and schools. Apart from this, as most of the libraries are old, that  should be furnished and maintained on a regular basis, along with adding an updated version of  materials, for instance, periodicals, magazines and newspapers. Conversely, digital libraries are affordable and convenient than traditional  ones.",
        "In conclusion, while advocates of the ge-old practice of going and reading  the traditional bookshelves say that they are essential,  some others think that these are unnecessary. I agree with the laters concept since it requires an large amount of space and investment to keep going. It is recommended that going digital is  better for the future."
