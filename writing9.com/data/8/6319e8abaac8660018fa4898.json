        "As the global world population has increased in the past few years, it has caused some people to be concerned that it may be the most troubling issue today. However, others believed in the exact opposite; that a higher population is not the most severe problem we face nowadays. Indeed, I believe in the former because it increases the demand for natural resources and forces more of us to live in ever smaller houses. In the following essay, both views are discussed below.",
        "In the beginning, The more growing population, the more spending on human resources. Turning resources into energy to live in our life. Nature, including food, wood, and water, is more frequently destroyed by humans. For example, for many people, who are fish lovers, when demand over supply, may lead to a fish distinction. The replacement of the wooden space by the structure of roads and buildings can flooding and the green glass effect of pollution afterwards. Furthermore, the contamination of the water, by manufacturing production.",
        "However, many argue that many populations acquired much more thought and design, and have new technologies, mechanisms, and tools. Subsequently, a trendy inventory is developed; for saving more power, and with the helping improvement of the production process, people get more convenience, nevertheless conserving fewer resources. For instance, using scooters in place of a car will help reduce air pollution. Also, if people can purchase more organic food rather than meat or fish, the preservation of resource use.",
        "To sum up, overpollution is the main significant environmental problem when we consider humans. It might be less of an issue if people changed their way of life."
