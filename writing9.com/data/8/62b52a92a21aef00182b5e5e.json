First of all, can you please share the Package details along with the dates, also is this a one-time trek or does it happen on different dates as well so that I will accommodate my leaves. Additionally, can you please share the list of items to carry during the tour. I had never been Trekking and it's one of my interests to complete this year and I am exhilarated about this.",
