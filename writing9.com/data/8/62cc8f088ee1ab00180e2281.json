        "We are all aware of the fact that finding the courage to take risks in life, both  professional and private,is very essential.Although doing  a daring action may lead to  some problems,I personally believe that its benefits outweigh the drawbacks in a long run.",
        "There are several potential dangers in front of people who are taking the risk.The very first one is being ended up embarrassed.It is obvious that if you are a risk-taker,the odds are that you will mess it up in some way.Things do not always go as we planned.Secondly,taking risks in private life can ruin relationships.Being in a relationship demands being serious in all matters.And one single risk,a single mistake can destroy families.Last but not least,taking risks at work can cost you a fortune.We know that some jobs require working with money like stock marketing or financing.In this kind of job, a risk may result in bankruptcy,sometimes.",
        "In spite of all drawbacks that are stated above,I am of the opinion that taking risks can help people improve themselves in every domain,whether it is professional or private.By taking risks,human beings get the chance to have unforgettable adventures during their lives.They see places they have never seen before,meet new people, make friends, and even  find the love of their lives.Most importantly,as a result of doing daring actions,people become experienced even if they fail in the end.By doing a mistake,we make a progress .We fall and stand up again.That is how humans have been evolving over the years.",
        "To conclude,I once reaffirm that although taking risks  may cause several problems in our professional and private lives,it seems to me that we gain more than we lose from taking a risk."
