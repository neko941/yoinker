        "Sugar is an integral part of our lives and in our daily food such as bread, candies, and cakes,\u2026 However, the government should raise the prices of sugary products in order to prevent customers from using too much sugar. As far as I am concerned, I totally disagree with the view that an increasing cost is not appropriate.",
        "To begin with, levying high prices on sugary products would cause hunger for the poor. In some cases, the poor need to buy sweet foods like juice, milk and usually contain sugar in order to maintain a full diet. Eating  sugar is also shown to store energy for the body and put sweet foods in people, you feel indeed improve your mood and comfort. For example, office workers run out of energy after a day's work, they need to eat snacks or candies that contain sugar to retrieve strength.",
        "The second reason why this issue is disapproved is that we could see that there are plenty of people who still buy sugary products in spite of high prices. Sweet-addicts are just too passionate about sugary food so they will spend their money getting what they want by all means. For instance, we can see that there is no help when wine and cigarettes are sold at high prices that people still buy for a huge amount. Therefore, it will make a lot of profit for the seller who wants to take advantage of a high price but low value. The last issue worth mentioning is the fact that the extra cost of sugary products will not be as effective as raising awareness in public. Since they can determine the number of sweet foods depends on individual demand to have a healthy diet.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that expensive sugary food will not affect the consumption of the eating habit. From that point, people need to have more knowledge to regulate their sugar levels to a suitable extent for their bodies."
