        "With the increased use of social media in the recent years, many people are becoming more concerned about the adverse effect, the networking media  has on the individuals and the society. While there are countless benefits of using social media, like Facebook and Instagram, in my opinion, uncontrolled and excessive use of such media  has its toll on both the individuals and the society.",
        "Undoubtedly, the advantages of using social media are many. Firstly, social media  has brought friends and relatives together more than ever before. This is especially true for those who live apart. We can now instantly reach  the dear ones  and circulate latest updates of each other, even if we are located in the different continent. Secondly, social media provides a positive platform to share knowledge with each other in the community or in an institution. For example, students can now easily share their notes and ideas with their classmates and even with their teacher using these platforms.",
        "However, the disadvantages of social media outweigh the advantages in several ways. Younger generations spends ample  of time each day on social networking. To give an example, my 16-year-old niece uploads a minimum of ten pictures every day, and share multiple statuses and moments on the Facebook. This, consequently, has affected her productivity and led to a decrease in study time, which in turn led to a poorer academic performance in college. In addition, sharing excessive personal information and moments publicly leads to a breach of an individual's privacy. People with bad intentions can now easily track individuals to do harm. For example, social networking provides a huge platform for cybercrime. Young girls committing suicide after experiencing bullying via  the internet is one of  common news in the newspapers around the world.",
        "To conclude, social networking is an inescapable reality of the modern civilization. Despite significant positive aspects of such media, the disadvantages of the platforms are many and need to be looked for.Individuals, especially youth should always use the networking site in moderation and keep their personal information private as much as possible."
