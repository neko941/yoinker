        "Interaction among near and dear ones has been affected in recent times due to several reasons. Factors causing this are the advent of social media and highly demanding jobs. This essay will discuss both  views and showcase the effects of both.",
        "Firstly, the development and use of the internet and online application have provided so many benefits to communicating with our family. Video calls across different continents were unthinkable many years before, but now with a single ,click we can chat or talk with our kin from different parts of the world. In my personal experience, for instance, I have interacted regularly with my friends over video chat who are in different countries, without any hassle. Moreover, corporate culture has also adapted to  modern times, by making working hours more flexible, encouraging people to spend more time with family. For example, many IT companies are providing laptops and internet dongles allowing employees to work more hours from home. This in turn helps people to utilize time at their home in a better way.",
        "Secondly, there are also palpable negative effects of apps and smartphones. Young people are seen spending less time with their parents and more time on applications like Instagram, Snapchat, and tik-tok. This has greatly reduced the emotional bonding between parents and their children. The consequence of this is that teenagers have dangerously become fascinated by the virtual world and are latched onto it, like a leech of human flesh. To my knowledge, recent studies have shown that  online apps are as addictive as an abuse of cocaine or marijuana. This is pulling young people away from their parents which in the long run will show adverse effects.",
        "To conclude, in current years, we have seen quite a lot of factors affecting bonding among family members. I completely agree that sharing and caring among family has largely deteriorated in past few years. If we don't take cognizance of it, it might cause dire consequences that will destroy the entire family."
