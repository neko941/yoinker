        "Many people suggested that there are more fundamental environmental issues while other opponents argue that the loss of  wildlife and animals is the major one that they are facing during these centuries. In my humble opinion, I strongly believe that we are facing a significant loss of fauna and plant species which are necessary for our daily lives as we are relying on them for our survival.",
        "On one hand, the advocates who assure that the main problem that they are facing the most right now is the extinction of  certain   species of  nature   during these decades as the world\u2019s population has been increasing enormously and they need more shelters than before so they have to cut down the trees and narrowed down the wildlife to build their homes. Since all humans require to eat in order to survive so people keep hunting down the animals not only for  food but also for their earning since certain  organisms such as tigers, crocodiles are manufactured into goods for their benefit. Most of the expensive and luxury clothes are made with faunas\u2019 skin.  They believe that most of the species will become extinct  if they ignore the wildlife.",
        "On the other hand, the opponents  suggest that they should focus on some other problems such as air pollution, water pollution and waste of plastic. As there are several industries has been increasing a lot which pollutes the air and affects humans\u2019 health.  In addition, plastic has been used notably even in unnecessary ones. Furthermore, they recklessly throw plastic in the oceans and seas which pollutes the water and affects its quality of it.  They expect that these   obstacles should be solved in a matter of time or the entire planet will be disappeared.",
        "From my perspective, all the problems that are mentioned before are crucial but the thing that is standing out to me most would be the loss of  nature.  As mentioned before, we, living organisms depend mostly on plants and other things for food and our shelters. If   we underestimate their values of them and keep doing things that are helping us only for a shortage of time such as hunting down the existence extremely in cases that are not vital and they are doing it just for money.",
        "To conclude, all environmental problems should not be neglected and should be solved within a shortage of time in order to save the environment."
