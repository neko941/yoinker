        "It is argued by some that life was more fulfilling when technology was less complex. I totally disagree with this statement because smartphones save us time and the internet  has improved education.",
        "Mobile phones such as i-phones have made our lives much less laborious and given us more free time. This is because jobs that used to require a lot of energy and time, now can be done at the touch of a button. For example, if people wanted to communicate in the past, they had to write a letter and take it to the post office and wait for it to be delivered, whereas nowadays people can simply tap the email icon on our touch screen and send a message to whomever they want to communicate with within seconds.",
        "The internet has also enriched our lives. In the past, pupils had to rely on a teacher and physical books but nowadays, people can find any information about their studies on the internet. As a result, they don't need to hire a tutor to help with their assignments. In other words, students can get any information that helps them to be more intelligent and effective learners. For example, there are many free apps on the internet and videos on youTube  available that assist students in their homework  so they can learn from anywhere in the world.",
        "In conclusion, this essay argues that life has been greatly improved by technological advancements, particularly labour-saving phones and the learning opportunities provided by the internet."
