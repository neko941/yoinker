        "Firstly, I would like to thank you for such a wonderful trip to the different places in my leisure time as well as the most delicious food that was prepared by your mom it was really tasty on the holidays. It was such an adventurous experience with you all that I have spent there.",
        "Secondly, when I  reached home just wondering not to see my wallet in my bag and suddenly I thought, at last, I was sitting in a living room before I went to the airport. In addition, it was colour in black and it's made up of leather fabric and has small pictures of a heart shape so that you could find it easily.",
        "Lastly, I would suggest you please send back my wallet as soon as possible by means of courier service so that I can collect it from the post office near my house.",
        "I look forward to your immediate response.",
