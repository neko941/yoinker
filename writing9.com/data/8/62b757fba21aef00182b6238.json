        "Dear Kamal,",
        "I hope you are doing well. It is great to hear that, you are going to start your higher studies at the same university. I would like to say, I was a student 2 years ago and during my study period, I lived in Kandy town. The place was located within walking distance to the university. Therefore, I was able to reduce my travelling cost.",
        "I would like to recommend the place, where I have stayed. The hostel's name was New boy's hostel in the main street. Additionally, they offered me several options such as a single room or a shared room. Apart from that, you will be able to have meals, laundry facilities and transport if  required.",
        "Further, you must be careful when choosing the correct hostel. Because some places are very far from the university and some places will not offer other facilities as I mentioned. If you are willing to stay at my place, you can contact them over the phone. Their contact number is 11223344.",
