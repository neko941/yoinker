        "I am writing this letter to bring to your notice the valuable item that I lost,while I was on a vacation to Dubai.Though I had insurance still, the emotions attached to it are precious.",
        "Firstly, the smartwatch that I had lost was as precious, as my wife had gifted me on my recent anniversary.Although it was a brand new Apple series 7 watch with a black leather belt it had no scratch on the glass just a small dent on the back of the charging slot.Moreover, because of peak hour time. there was a lot of rush on Metro and I think that's the moment I lost it. Traffic that day was very much because it was Friday and people were in hurry to not miss the afternoon's prayer.",
        "Finally, I would love to have the lost watch again but it doesn't seem that way I would want you to refund the Insurance amount in my account so that I can have the pleasure of wearing it again soon.",
        "Looking forward to an update from you soon.",
        "Your's sincerely",
        "Tushar K Patel."
