        "Digital media versus the University library has become an integral part of the rising debate in today's world. The proponents of  digital media believe that it has more advantages compared to the physical library. In my opinion,  digital material has more benefits than paper-based libraries. In this essay, I will discuss both pros and cons of digital media  as compared to print media.",
        "There are several reasons for my stance, first and foremost is the ease of searching a multitude of databases online. This is because now all the libraries are stored online, as a result, students find it very easy to access these by just searching the abstract of the article rather than stalling the libraries for hours. For instance, the research conducted by the American University also reflects on similar terms, and therefore, it can be said that the proposition is convincingly justified. Secondly, these digital libraries can be accessed anywhere whether it is a cafe, car or home via  internet access. Hence, as mentioned above there are huge benefits of digital media.",
        "On the contrary, there is one major con to these digital platforms and that is the adverse impact on health . This is because  the LED screen time if extended for more than 5 hours every day can be detrimental to the eyes in long run. For instance, the latest research by the Medical Association of Australia has revealed that there are major side-effects of prolonged screen time as the LED light affects the eyes. Thus, in a nutshell, the aforementioned discussion justifies my stance.",
        "In conclusion, I still believe the benefits of  digital media are multitude including vast online searches and easy access. However, it does have a negative impact on health. Even though, in my opinion, the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages."
