        "Advancement in technology has made it possible for humans to work at home. There is a statement saying that working at home only benefits employees, not their bosses. From my perspective, I disagree with this idea because I believe employers can benefit from this trend.",
        "On the one hand, workers are thought to be the only ones who can take advantage of working at home. Since employees do not have to travel a long way to work, they can save a considerable amount of time spent commuting and waiting in traffic jams. Furthermore, money allocated to transport such as petrol, buses, and trains can be lessened, which reduces the financial burden on workers. Besides, working at home provides employees with comfort and safety. They may not run the risk of involving in an accident or suffering from bad weather conditions on the way to work. Therefore, there are various advantages for workers if they choose to work at home.",
        "On the other hand, I argue not only can employees benefit from teleworking but also employers. Firstly, allowing workers to work at their homes could be more financially efficient because entrepreneurs would not have to cover the cost of running offices such as renting and housekeeping staff costs. Secondly, workers can concentrate on their business better if they are working in an ideal environment, thus enhancing productivity. Finally, employers can make workers satisfied by letting them work at home. As a result, employees will work at their best and be loyal to their organizations.",
        "In conclusion, despite the idea pointing out that only workers can be advantaged from teleworking, I believe working at home is beneficial for employees and their bosses as a hold. Development in technology will always bring good things to humans."
