The online studies are much famous because of its benefits and is in a position to replace the traditional method of learning.

Furthermore, they are not having the discipline and punctuality. Lack of these qualities and feelings often have a negative impact on the kid's character and the future. For Example, in a survey conducted by Kerala authority among student's pursing course through the online and schools, reveals that, the students who are in traditional system are ready to hear other's issue and help them.",
        "In conclusion, e-learning is having advantage like can learn from anywhere at anytime, but it has major drawbacks by reducing the empathy and the emotions of a child."
