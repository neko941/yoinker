        "There is a controversial statement heating a debate over the fact that it is a complete waste of time to stay up-to-date with the latest news and information since it might be irrelevant to our life. While this thinking is valid to a certain extent, I would contend that news still is of essence to people\u2019s daily life for various justifications.",
        "It is irrefutable that under several circumstances that absorbing news on written articles or social networking sites is a waste of time. In this day and age, with the advancements of cutting-edge technology that there is a myriad of sources of information being circulated constantly. However, the majority of them are in a ceaseless pursuit of disseminating sensational news such as celebrities\u2019 life or love affairs which bear almost no value for our life when getting access to this kind of information. For instance, some broadcasters are dispersing last-minute information about the breakup between Kanye West and Julia Fox but it is obvious that viewers may hardly learn anything from this news. Without a shadow of a doubt, it is an absolute waste of time to read these sources of information.",
        "While it is true that it is extremely time-consuming to reach some anecdotal news nowadays, there is always a latent connection between everyday news and people\u2019s life. Notably, news transfers an eclectic mix of prompt information ranging from a broad variety of fields and topics that each might draw an appeal to a certain target audience. For example, while sports enthusiasts might kindle interest in global sport-related news such as reports of international sports leagues, information about new inventions of medicine or diagnosis to cure fatal diseases might be the topic of interest for pharmacists and doctors. Therefore, it is by no means that news is irrelevant to our life.",
        "To sum up, while there are some situations that news on TV programs or printed newspapers can cost people time to read, I strongly believe that news still gradually link to our life."
