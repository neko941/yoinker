        "Capital punishment has been awarded for criminals in many countries  since the time of immemorial. However, there remains some disagreement that whether this is beneficial or not. In my opinion, I strongly believe that sentenced to death can be an effective  solution in order to reduce the crime rate in society.",
        "On the one hand, it is an indisputable fact that the death penalty is an affordable method  to  a long term imprisonment. Otherwise, taxpayers foot the bill for long term  accommodation of convicts. By penalising  deliquescent  by execution, this problem can be eliminated. Apart from this, they  would learn that any crime is a crime that punishable offence and this is wrong. For instance, a Country like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where those who commit serious  crimes; blasphemy, adultery, and consuming alcohol, are punished with death penalty.",
        "On the other hand,  there are some people argue that instead of awarding an execution order, convicts are re- educated and re- socialised. In other word, those who enter the prison should  be trained any skilled job to find  out some employment after releasing  from prison.  Similarly, they must be undergone various counselling and rehabilitation sections  and prepare them to adopt the life outside the jail. Obviously, they might experience some difficulty when they enter the real world, such as exclusion, non -acceptance from the society, therefore, this assistance would enable them to  tackle this issue effectively.",
        "By way of conclusion, people have differed regarding capital punishment, I, again reaffirm that the  death penalty has more benefits to society both economic and safety reasons."
