        "Nowadays, a large part of the state budget is spent on medicine, not on the environment. Many people think the medical treatment has to be more important than climate change. I both agree and disagree with this view.  In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this statement.",
        "Many governments are focusing on medical investigation instead of the environment. Many medical drugs are produced from plants, which grow in nature. Apart from this, many incurable diseases result from the deterioration of climate. For example, if the country's climate is very polluted, most of the locals will be sick with various types of illnesses. Furthermore, many countries have a lot of factories that produce very toxic chemical fumes. If the world climate continues to be polluted by tox, none of the medicine can save people from diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, COPD and lung cancer.  To protect the environment, governments should control the production of plastics because the factories that produce them emit fumes that are very harmful to humans.",
        "On the other hand, the government has to pay attention to medical treatment to detect and treat new undiagnosed diseases. For instance, good nature alone is not enough for many people to recover, in this case, people have to use the medicine. Society should be attentive to medication for the treatment of various chronic diseases.",
        "In conclusion, the government has to spend most of the cash on medicine. If they spend money on climate, they cannot fix all problems that are related to illnesses. In my opinion, if nature is good, diseases will decrease as well, there is no need for excessive medical procedures. The government should spend money on both researching the environment and medical research."
