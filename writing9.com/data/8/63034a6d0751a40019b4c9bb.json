        "These days, we could access any kind of details on the Internet. One of the examples is study books, which are available in electronic format. There are some drawbacks to this technological innovation. However, I think this obtaining information from the websites is in favour of us in many ways. In this essay, I am going to discuss some related benefits and downsides of this subject.",

For instance,  a study by The EBL on 1000 students about distinguishing the understanding of the student from the eBook and real book. And the result is  a fever of physical book readers. This means  that those who refer to eBooks are not able to get thorough information.",
