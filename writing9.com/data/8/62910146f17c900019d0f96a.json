        "in the olden times, most  the students used to attend traditional classes in schools; although, in the recent period, with new advancements in the tech sector modern students including myself prefer to use the new methods of learning and save money and benefit from the convenience of using their smart-devices for leaning.",
        "Firstly, nowadays most students are struggling with financial troubles related to their education process. Considering student expenses such as the cost of transportation for attending  old fashioned lectures or alternatively stationery expenses. Nevertheless, if  educators select learning with smart devices like computers they could save an extreme amount of money by not paying transportation fees and buying stationery regularly as online learning through recent advancements, students are able to attend  classes from home only with their smart screens and typing instead of the traditional way of not taking on pen and paper. This is one major advantage why students may prefer to save extra money by selecting this alternative.",
        "Perhaps even more importantly, the convenience and comforts of studying with machinery is another reason I and other students prefer to learn online. Thanks to technological advancements in the recent century people tend to not waste their time and get tired with everyday commuting to lectures as they could learn on their comfortable couch, getting done their home-workes with pressing some buttons of their personal computers. For instance, most of the students who resumed their education by digital methods saw incredible improvements in their final exams, because they study comfortably from their home and do not have stress and could save an enormous amount of time as well.",
        "In the way of conclusion, even though, the old generation used to attend  the lectures traditionally, today many like prefer to select the digital method of learning because it is more comfortable and cheap at the same time."
