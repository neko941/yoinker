        "There is more gratifying for people from science and technology background rather than the music and art field in the current society. I agree entirely with the latest trend, and this essay will describe the perspective reasons behind it.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, artist and musicians showing their talent in front of people such as music, painting. However, they are also teaching them thoughts, knowledge, expertise in various sectors because of multiple reasons such as, attract an audience, demonstrating the ability to people. For Example, Justin Bieber is widely known around the world for his fantastic music. Therefore, they earned millions of dollars throughout his career.",
        "",
        "One of the crucial reason is that scientist plays a vital role in human lives by providing various innovations with long-term solutions which provide benefits to the community. Moreover, the scientist does spend a long time of his own life on a single invention which would give the benefits to current society. For instance, Karl Benz is an engineer and invented the car which runs with solar, and it is providing an enormous benefit to the people. In other words, the technology not only improves human lives but also save the planet from toxic smoke that comes from regular vehicles. Another aspect is a scientist is highly appreciated as spends hours to improve human beings through technology. Thus, these people are more considered by other sectors. Therefore, because scientist sacrifice is more valued than money and the time they spent on very expensive, they deserve more importance than artist and musician.",
        "",
        "In conclusion, scientist and technology specialist are considered more appreciated by their ability, talent, knowledge when compared to the artist. I completely agree with this; technology improves peoples lives and made a more comfortable lifestyle. It can be adjusted in favour of several benefits such as less smoke in the air from regular vehicles."
