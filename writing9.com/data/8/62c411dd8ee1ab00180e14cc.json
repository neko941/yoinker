        "Recently, the debate on which channel is better for people to make new friends has been heated. While some people claim that face-to-face interaction can maintain the relationship, I agree with those who argue that using social sites may provide multiple opportunities for making friends. In this essay, I will outline both sides and illustrate my view.",
        "To begin with, a sustainable friendship can be made in reality. Since there is less fake information in the real world compared to the virtual ones, the public may tell more about themselves when meeting others face-to-face. For example, difficulties can be shared in group gatherings. Therefore, mutual understanding, which creates from small talks, can build up a stronger connection between friends and further boost their friendships.",
        "On the other hand, I would argue that social platforms can expose the general public to a wider range of options when it comes to making friends. As the geographic barrier, as well as the social barrier, can be broken by modern technology, it seems easier for citizens to find out those who share similar interests and communicate with them. For instance, people can follow and chat with others on Instagram once they are interested in the blogger. Therefore, the public may gain more capacity to make new friends regardless of others\u2019 region or social status through the internet.",
        "In conclusion, although making friends through face-to-face meetings may solidify the relationship, online chatting may be more beneficial as it encourages citizens to interact with others from all over the world."
