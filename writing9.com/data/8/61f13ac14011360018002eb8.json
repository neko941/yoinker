To illustrate, Delhi is the most polluted capital in the world, so the government of that particular capital has taken strict action  by implementing the 'Odd-Even' rule and it is found that it plays a crucial role in handling the situation.Hence,with the involvement of , the government this problem could be solved efficiently both service problem and deterioration has been reduced.",
