        "In the contemporary world, scientific studies are funded and carried out by private firms rather than state-owned ones. In my opinion, although it can be beneficial for such a phenomenon to occur, I believe that its benefits are eclipsed by the disadvantages.",
        "On the one hand, advocators might hold an opinion that research sponsored and produced by private companies is advantageous. The first reason is that this action can relieve the burden on the governmental budget. To be more specific, it is believed that public-sector finance should be allocated to solve problems in other fields such as education and the environment, not just scientific research alone. Therefore, if private enterprises subsidize some experiments, this will not only help the government tackle the remaining issues but also develop the nation. In addition, governmental organizations often have to deal with excessive bureaucratic red tape, which slows down the process of research. In contrast, private firms can simplify the procedures and boost the efficiency of these experiments and achieve the outcome in the shortest amount of time.",
        "On the other hand, I think that there are still some disadvantages that cannot be avoided when fewer programs are controlled by national authorities. Although people can deliver the results of the research faster, some of them might be manipulated and distorted by private companies. In particular, were it not for the administration of stringent rules implemented by governments,  some pharmaceutical companies can alter the numbers in their reports to create counterfeit drug efficacy. Secondly,  when it comes to global research, studies conducted by non-governmental organizations may lack extensive details due to the fact that a private company can only carry out scientific experiments in a specific area or race. Thus, it is better for the governmental groups to perform most scientific procedures because they can cooperate with other countries.",
        "In conclusion, there are some promising outcomes of private corporations doing research in the field of science. However, I believe that the drawbacks overshadow the advantages."
