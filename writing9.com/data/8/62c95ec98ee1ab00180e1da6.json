She has been prescribed  certain medications to be taken timely and to undergo numerous chemotherapies. My parents, being old, cannot take this stress solely.",

Not only this but also I will always be available at your disposal even after my placement in another city. Hence this is my earnest request to shift me internally from the Dubai office to Mumbai headquarters. If this comes to a fruition, I will no longer be required to search for a new job to look after my sister during her tough time.",
