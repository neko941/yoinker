        "I am writing regarding the food served in your hotel during an event held by my company on 6th February 2020. Although the members participating in the event liked the design of the hotel and also praised the facilities offered by your diligent staff ,the participants were all upset due to the quality of the food served at  lunch.",
        "However, the food was so oily and the vegetables were not cooked fresh, consequently the members in the meeting didn\u2019t like the food and started complaining. Hence,  the manager of my company who was hosting the event felt embarrassed as nobody was eating the food.",
        "Furthermore, our  company is hosting some more crucial meetings with our clients in the near future, and to avoid this type of situation, I would like to suggest that the food must be freshly cooked without any excessive oil. I recommend that you add some pasta and ice cream to your menu.",
        "I hope you understand my concerns and appreciate them.",
