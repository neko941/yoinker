        "I am writing to apply for a Japanese Instructor position at the Language Institute of Kyoto that was advertised in The Times newspaper on Sunday 8th May. I would like to describe my qualifications and experience to you.",
        "I graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in the Japanese language from the University of Osaka and a master\u2019s degree in teaching at Boston University. When I pursued my bachelor's, I did an internship as a translator at a digital media company called ABCD News for six months. After finishing my master's, I worked as a Japanese teacher at  Jackson High School for three years. In my previous job, I was responsible for educating and instructing children.",
        "The Language Institute of Kyoto has a high-standard institute with a good reputation. I believe that my experience with Japanese, specifically in  teaching, makes me the best match for this position I truly enjoyed what I was doing, which is what drew me to this position with your company. Please let me know if you need any other information. I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
