Additionally, it was one of the best trips I ever had in my life, as it was a new country for me I learn a lot more because of companions like you. The best moment I cannot forget is when we had a wonderful ride on a toboggan.",

The moment I came back, I had a lot of pendency at my workplace because I took a week off from it. In addition to it, my manager wanted the reports as soon as possible. Furthermore, I request you to visit my country as from now it is a great time to spend here. It is said that after the month of August is known as a festival season for India and it would also be a great moment to visit as well as, we can spend a whale of a time",
