        "I recently had to travel to Milton from Toronto to meet one of my nephews who just moved from India for higher education. I am Asian, but I never had a problem with any of the Canadians because of my race. This is the first time someone made me feel extremely uncomfortable and was racist to my face. The cab driver kept asking me a hundred questions about why we Asians moved to Canada. He started to state how much we have destroyed the country and economy. He wanted to know how I would feel if he moved to India and ruled the country, but it is a well known fact that the British ruled our country and made us slaves in our own country.",
        "All this behaviour made me feel stressed and horrible. I would like that drive fired immediately so that no other person has to experience what I went through. I hope my complaint is taken seriously and immediately processed.",
