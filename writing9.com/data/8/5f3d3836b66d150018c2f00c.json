        "It is true that in the recent years people have been suffering from the dramatic grow of the amount of waste and environmental pollution. While this is a serious problem, I believe that some measures can be taken to address this situation.",
        "Pollution and greater wastage levels apparently have some drawbacks to people's lives, especially their health. More serious air pollution can be disadvantageous, especially for those who suffer from breathing problems. For instance, 30 percent of people who respond to a survey conducted by Hanoi Medical University in Vietnam claim that decreasing air quality is having negative effects on their health. Furthermore, larger amount of waste in residential areas might cause the environment around to be polluted, including food and plants that are used by human. If people consume these things, they are likely to suffer from some serious diseases.",
        "However, researchers have come up with several solutions to this problem, and suggest some effective ways to resolve them. Firstly, the government should raise awareness among residents to improve the quality of the environment by processing less waste. For example, people just need to do something simple like throwing rubbish into trash can and not littering along the way. Secondly, encouraging people to plant more trees is also considered to contribute greatly to a less contaminated environment. Trees are known to absorb carbon dioxide, a factor that contributes to air pollution, and produce oxygen, a substance that is needed for a greener life.",
        "In conclusion, although ascending levels of waste and pollution can have serious impacts on normal people's lives, I believe that this problem can be tackled by helping people to be aware of the urge to produce less waste and encouraging them to plant more and more trees."
