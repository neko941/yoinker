        "How are you? I hope you're fine. It's been so long since we've written to each other. I'm writing to inform you that I applied for a scholarship in one of the schools there in Canada and recently I received an email from the school that I got accepted.",
        "The school is just a little nearer to where you live and it's well-known for accepting international students all over the world for so many years. Anyway, the course I'm planning to study there is Horticulture Technician. Ever since I was a kid, it's been a hobby of mine to engross myself in landscaping and planting. I'm always interested in anything related to different kinds of plants. It was like a pastime for me back then, now I want to take it to a higher level of learning.",
        "You've been in Canada for years now, I'm sure you're already familiar with the place there. If you don't mind, I'm asking you favour in helping me find a place to stay while studying there. If possible, the accommodation is affordable and not far from the university, so I won't have to use the money for transportation.",
        "I would really appreciate it if you can give me a positive response at your earliest. Looking forward to meeting you soon.",
