        "Many people argue that neighbourhood cannot be improved until this cannot be a mandatory lesson for children in their academics at the school. I strongly believe that this would make a dramatic change in society if this has been included.",
        "Firstly, in this hectic world, youngsters are busy with their academics mainly concentrating on the subjects like maths and science. This would make them towards an impressive growth trajectory. However, they are not been involved in their local areas and do some good activities voluntarily. For instance, in Japan, there is a special subject such as volunteer program as a mandated program included in their syllabus. This would make youngsters how important their neighbourhood make improvement. This would not only improve the current generations but also the posterity. Hence, this type of program could be implemented by the school",
        "Secondly, the juveniles are recently been involved in online games and watching violent programs in their free time. This is because they have an ample amount of time after school. If this type of subject were included in the school, they could be part of their community services and start involved and do some better services. This not only brings their satisfaction to them but also to their community. For example, the survey concludes that 70% of the schools in India implemented this unpaid community service program in their academics. This would make them mature enough and well progress in their carrier as  good human beings in the near future.",
        "In Conclusion, offsprings are capable to understand if this unpaid community service program is included in their syllabus. Otherwise, they would waste a lot of their time on electronic gadgets."
