        "I must mention that we liked pretty much everything about the hotel, including its hygiene and cleanliness, great customer service, large lounge area and high-speed internet service. We also liked the fact that the conference hall of your hotel, where we organized an all-day-meeting without any trouble, was very spacious and comfortable with all kinds of modern facilities and amenities.",
        "",
        "However, when it came to the food that we were served, I am afraid I cannot say the same, and some of our participants complained about it. Some of your items were not properly cooked. In fact, I felt like the food was cooked by some amateur chef. Besides, the \u201cCroquetas de Jamon\u201d, you served, tasted like it was heated in the microwave, and as a result, it tasted very stale. Anyway, without getting into any further details, I would like to ask you to tell your chefs to be a bit more careful about the food they serve to your valuable customers.",
