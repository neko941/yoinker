        "In some countries, the government provides subsidies or even pays all of the cost of children's education. Although it might cause a few problems, I believe that overall it has more benefits than drawbacks.",
        "Education can cost a huge amount of money in lots of countries and become a burden on people. Some parents are having a hard time working and trying to afford the tuition. In order to help  poor families, the governments give subsidies, which can make the parents less pressured.",
        "Indeed, there are several disadvantages to this policy. One of the most significant problems is that it would affect the financial plan of the nation. If an authority spends too much money on education,the budget for other departments, such as infrastructure and technology, would be reduced.",
        "However, the advantages of supporting children's education are irreplaceable. First of all, children from either wealthy or poor families would receive the same education and all have equal opportunities to succeed in the future. In the long term, this would narrow the wealth gap within the countries and therefore reduce potential social problems. In addition, the parents could feel less stressed, so their mental well-being would be improved.",
        "In conclusion, even though paying for children's education could be a difficult decision for the governments, I am convinced that the advantages outweigh its disadvantages. Thus, I consider that  governments should continue such a policy."
