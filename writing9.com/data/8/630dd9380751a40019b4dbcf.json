        "Some people argue that the international community should restrict all countries from consuming excessive fossil fuels. Overall, I agree with the idea. Although it might lead to a few problems, I believe that its advantages outweigh its disadvantages.",
        "On one hand, one of the main problems with stopping countries from consuming fuels is that some of them might run into an energetic crisis . For example, some small countries which are less wealthy might not be able to find alternative energy or develop eco-friendly methods to produce electricity. As a result, the residents in these countries might face problems in their daily lives.",
        "However, on the other hand, a decrease in fossil fuel consumption has even more advantages. First of all, it means that less carbon dioxide would be released into the atmosphere. In this way, it could effectively slow down global warming, stop icebergs from melting  and reduce the rise of sea levels. In addition, it can also reduce contamination, which is a threat to the environment and endangered animal species.",
        "Moreover, since there are only limited resources on earth, using less gas and oil is also a significant issue for the next generation. For instance, if we consume too many natural resources and run out of them, people in the future would not be able to produce electricity and drive vehicles as we do.",
        "Overall, reducing the consumption of fossil fuels over the world obviously has more benefits than drawbacks. Thus, I am convinced that the international community should take action to regulate all nations in the world."
