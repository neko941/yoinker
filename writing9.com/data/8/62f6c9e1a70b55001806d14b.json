        "In our modern society, it is quite easy to see a variety of opinions between different generations. Some people believe that the younger generation should listen well ideas of the old one, however others argue that they should challenge the old opinions. In this essay, both views will be discussed, then I will state my opinion in conclusion.",
        "First of all, some people think that teenagers should follow the old thoughts because of the religious aspect. For example, respecting older people is vital for most religions, especially Buddhism which is believed by the majority of the citizens in my country. Moreover, they have an opportunity that employees get fired if we do not follow elderly opinions in a company, which leads to a quite difficult situation for their life. Thus, this makes it clear that teenagers should listen to the old generation carefully.",
        "In contrast, others believe that the younger generation should challenge the old ideas for making our society better. For instance, new ideas from them are able to change companies in a wonderful way even though usually older people do not prefer changing systems. Recent research conducted by a famous university in New York showed that the United States have a large number of successful companies because they can express their opinion to the old generation. Therefore, it has become apparent that teenagers should say their opinions.",
        "In conclusion, we discussed both views in terms of religions and making our life better. In my opinion, we should challenge the old thoughts because the younger generation\u00b4s ideas with the new technology can change our society in a good way considerably. After a thorough analysis of this subject, it is predicted that the younger generation will try to express their opinions more in the future."
