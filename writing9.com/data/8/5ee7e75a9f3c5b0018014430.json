In addition, the company has already booked the tickets, and it is mandatory for all the employees to attend the conference. Since you have not been booked your tickets yet, we can still decide on a different date. I will be back on 30th March and my vacation would be until 20th April, so please let me know whichever date is feasible for you, and then we can plan accordingly. I know this must be an inconvenience because of such short notice, but I hope you understand, and I sincerely apologize for this trouble this may have caused.",
