        "It is irrefutable that quality matter more than the quantity and price of the consumable item. Solving of regional food should be preferred other than imported material. a number of reasons are responsible behind its influence and I believe that it always leaves a positive impact on people's mind.I firmly disagree to present statement,However, I tend to think in the opposite direction, I would like to explicate it at length in the paragraphs to come.",
        "To begin with, I believe that there are certain reasons to justify the value of spending money on quality products. Firstly, variation in the taste of an individual is must required in today's era. Masses get bored while consuming local trending items whereas they are in need of a variety of possibilities such as  India has a trend of consuming western culture food products. In addition, an unbelievable demanding of foreign ingredients. Customers are command different eatable components which are not possible to manufacture in their nation. To Exemplify, India is the largest jute producing country which leads to the trading of jute around the world.",
        "Moreover, the business of trading digestible components would be beneficial for the nations.important not only builds up relationships with other countries but also break down domestic monopolies, which face competition from more efficient foreign firms. Furthermore, trading supports more productivity, higher-paying jobs in our export sector. It provides employment for citizens in different sectors of work area such as shipping, transportation and packaging sectors. Thus, it leaves some positive aspects of humans.",
        "In conclusion, I recapitulate that there is innumerable strong argument supporting the retailing of foreigner credence which means that it is inseparable from over sophisticated life. However, its loopholes can be curbed."
