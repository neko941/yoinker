        "Actually it will be my father's anniversary, 50 years. There will be a lot of our relatives and friends from different parts of the world. On top of that my mother rented a humongous space in the centre of Moscow. There will be plenty of food, come music performance and at the end my father is going to give a speech.",
        "I am really sorry, but there is no way I may skip the event. I should have planned it more carefully before revealing it to you.",
        "I suppose the party will take a day or two. If I was able to change my airline tickets, I would be able to come as soon as possible. Will it work for you if I come, for example, a week after the initial plan?",
        "Please let me know about your ideas regarding that.",
