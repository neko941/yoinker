        "When checking the happiness index, rarely developed countries secure  a good position. There are many people who think that country which have an advanced level of financial status, no longer able to make its citizen  feel much content by introducing  more developments. I strongly agree with this standpoint.",
        "To begin with, after attaining a stable level of an economy, many residents may not feel delighted by seeing their country's advancement. This is because when a person satisfies his or her basic needs, the next level is  to attain self-actualisation. For this, they have to  find something to make them content, for instance, doing charity works, helping  the needy or contributing to the  well-being of disadvantaged. Therefore, they could find the purpose of their life and joy in their actions.",
        "Another reason here is that lack of personal relationship. In other words, when a nation assists its people, they rarely require support from their family and slowly and gradually blood-relationships can be blemished. However, for example, during their younger age they could chase all the luxuries and  achievement but, it has been  noticed that these people often end-ups in a depressive  mood in their later years. Thus, by viewing all these, it is clear that, economical  progress of a nation may not bring happiness to its residents.",
        "In conclusion, even though it seems that living in a country which has a  fast-growing economy results from joy among the native . In my opinion, I firmly reiterate this argument as there is no proof  to support this."
