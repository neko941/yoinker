        "The main purpose of writing this letter is to gain your attention towards  Jumeirah lake. Currently, I have seen many wastages  floating on the surface of the water. I have been living near  the lake for the past 20 years and I have never seen such nonsense earlier.",
        "For the last ,month one camp was placed on the west of the lake. Many people are in that camp. It is, to be ,honest to blame them  because always water flows from the west. Members of that camp are throwing out the waste and litter. Therefore, water bottles, plastic bags, and garbage bags are floating on the surface of the water.",
        "I would suggest you, inform them to move the camp elsewhere. Or you can punish them by issuing heavy fines and it is good to take the necessary steps to clean the lake as early as possible. Because delay can cause many serious issues for the health of people.",
        "I hope that I will see the results within a couple of days.",
        "Looking for your fast action on the above issue.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
