        "I received your letter and I got to know that you are in a situation where you cannot decide on the path that you need to choose going forward. I strongly believe that selecting the carrier in the \"Information Technology(IT)\" section would suites for you instead of going to college.",
        "Firstly, these days it is really hard to find a low-cost college due to the economic situation in Sri Lanka. Hence, all the courses are way more expensive than the amount that you could effort at the moment. Thus, you would not enjoy studying while managing your expenses.",
        "Secondly, I heard that your father lost his job during the Covid pandemic and still he could not find a suitable job in his stream. Therefore, finding a job related to your skilled area might be able to support your family expenses during this crisis. In addition, you might be able to save some amount so that you could spend on your future goals.",
        "Finally, as you always demonstrate the skills of an entrepreneur I suggest you be the person you always wanted to be. Since you have the ability to develop websites I think you will be a good fit in the IT industry.",
        "I wish you good luck in your future endeavours.",
