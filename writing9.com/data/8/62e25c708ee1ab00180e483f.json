        "Some think that it is better to have your lovely vocation without considering salary, whereas others believe that a good salary contributes to a better life generally. I mainly believe that practising enjoyable work and getting money by working for a wonderful company is  much more important than a good salary.",
        "On one hand, there are many reasons why people opine that salary is uselessly unimportant compared to an enjoyable work atmosphere. The prominent reason is the belief that money is not all that humans have to search for while there are several things and feelings that people have to consider. For example, the quietness in their workplace, and that sense of togetherness that can lead to peaceful and efficient work in the organization. In addition, creating a variety of friendly relationships is incredibly nice and helpful for guaranteeing a more convenient job atmosphere.",
        "On the other hand, some people see that the essential part of having a job is the salary which could positively change your utter life. Additionally, they believe it has the power to enhance your life by putting you in a high position in your society. Moreover, it might help society get rid of poverty. For instance, a worker who has an enormous income and salary can help poor people by giving them money or even providing a convenient shelter for them if they do not.",
        "In a nutshell, after weighing up both sides of the argument, I have come to the conclusion that even though the salary is a vital purpose of having a job, choosing your lovely vocation, and working on what you are interested in is much more practical and vital. From my perspective, I think that I can do both earn money and enjoy my occupation also."
