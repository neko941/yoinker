        "First of all, congratulations on getting admission to the university of Texas. I have studied there too and can tell that you will definitely enjoy student life there.",
        "Maybe this will help you, I was staying in a two-bedroom apartment with my classmate very near to the university on tank road. It was just ten minutes walk for me to reach college. I recommend you to find accommodation nearby only. Do not go out with an agent hunting for apartments, rather try searching on the internet and finalize three or four places then go there to check them out personally to check the area and convenience of market, food and emergency facilities. However, one thing that I wanted to warn you about is that you must carry your own utensils, table fan and TV as non of these things would be provided in any house.",
