        "There is no doubt that some area requires more investment than other sectors. Although it is normal to see governments  spend on art galleries, music institutions and theatres, in my opinion,basic infrastructures are required to be developed. This is because this would improve the standard of living and quality of life.",
        "Firstly, when the government funds the development of the nation, eventually, this can uplift its citizens' lives as well. In other words,  these basic amenities are provided to meet the necessity. For example,If the authority constructs new roadways to a remote village, which will assist not only help the villagers to access to cities, but  allows them to do some trading as well.  Similarly, this enables to afford modern facilities and can have gradual progress of the entire country.",
        "secondly,  spending money on these aesthetic buildings may not bring any drastic changes to the place as it can be benefited only a fraction of the society. Additionally, the impact on the general public is minimum since it is not capable of eliminating the needs of hunger, house and cloths. For instance, in the UAE, they had given much focus on constructing big buildings, roadways, and hospitals, before squandering a huge amount on other sectors. They have proved they are right and currently one of the richest countries in the world despite their growth was gradual.",
        "In conclusion, people have a different view on how to channelise the government fund whether to develop infrastructure or spend another advancement. I strongly think they must fund trivial areas rather any other project."
