        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter to show my immense dissatisfaction with my recent horrible holiday trip to St. Cera towns 25 Km far from Miami Beach with booking reference number p13634511 and I require a full refund of my money.",
        "At the onset, I vividly remember you described to me this holiday offer on the 23rd of last month and listed a lot of benefits such as free dinner and city rides along with insurance. Because not a single benefit was available there, I had to spend extra $450 to get avail stay and meal options. Honestly, being a regular customer, I have never expected this kind of false information from your side.",
        "Therefore, I want a full refund of my booking amount of $250 as I had paid all my expenses for the trip at that place separately. Hence, it would be sufficient for you to transfer the whole amount by next Friday into my account lest a legal discourse should be followed by me against you for deceiving me with wrong information. I hope you would understand the genuinity of my situation and act accordingly.",
        "Look forward to hearing from you soon.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
