        "It is widely argued that global resources trending toward depletion due to high consumer demand. There are a number of reasons behind this point of view and several solutions should be proposed to improve these problems.",
        "There are two primary reasons why the consumption of resources is increasing at a great rate. One reason is the industrialization and modernization of countries. Developing countries drag on using more energy and fossil for manufacturing. In addition, industrialization grows many factories leading to the use of much more electricity for production.  Another reason is that the population explosion makes increasing the consumption of natural resources. Individuals use energy such as gasoline to run their cars and electricity to operate furniture in their homes. As a result, water and gasoline exploit more than the capacity self-resilience of nature.",
        "However, measures must be taken by the government and international bodies to change demand using resources. Firstly, authorities require higher taxes to reduce demand. When everyone has to pay money for what they consume, they will use more save power. For instance, with increasing gasoline, everyone changes to using vehicles public instead of driving private to go to their work. Secondly, educate individuals not to waste resources. For example, turn off the light when going out or going to bed. Furthermore, invest in developing renewable sources of energy forward a growing sustainable economy that goes together to protect the environment and use power effectively.",
        "In conclusion, the world\u2019s resource consumption is too rapidly, so solutions need to apply emergency to resolve problems and protect the environment need as a top priority \u2013 ensuring \u201csome for all instead of \u201c more for some\u201d."
