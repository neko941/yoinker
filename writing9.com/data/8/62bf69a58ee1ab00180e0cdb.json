        "Last month, the colour of my house was getting faded and it required a new touch. Therefore, I decided to give this contract to your firm as you are one of the best contractors in the town. However, I am satisfied with most of  your efforts but there are some issues which I have found below the mark. This includes the colour of the main door and the most left wall of the house, the leftover and the cleaning.",
        "First of all, the coat of paint on the entrance gate and the left wall is not up to the mark. It is coming out from the surface in patches, this will not only gives them the worst look but also will cause rusting on the metal gate and seepage from the wall. Also, at the beginning of the work, it was decided that at the completion of work your labour will dispose of all the scrap and also clean and wash the place completely but it didn't happen at all.",
        "You are requested to send your staff to complete the unsatisfactory tasks. Moreover, instruct them to take all the garbage from here.",
        "I look forward to your kind assistance.",
        "Yours' sincerely,",
