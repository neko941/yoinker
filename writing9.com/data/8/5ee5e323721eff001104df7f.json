        "First of all, development of technology in nowadays is being a part with life to living in society. Therefore, parents are thinking about this high technology will be destroying children's life in the future. A smart call up within an application and can be accessed to the internet is should be killing kids' brain to learning anything that  raises up in this moment's time.  Violence from the assessment must lead all children to follow as a game that they are playing. For example, The age of kid that should not let them play or use a cell dial is from 3 to 10years old. By the age, they must be followed from what they have seen from the social media.",
        "However, still have some people are accepted to taking care of their children, by using as IT. It is because, when parents have to work  and spend their lifetime in the work place more than home. Despite having negative to their kids.

Therefore, from my point of view,  I agree with parents that who is saying, Digital accessories are disadvantage more than an advantage"
