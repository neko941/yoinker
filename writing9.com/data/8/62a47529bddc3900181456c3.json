        "It is well-known that mass voluntary migration comes from some developing countries. Some people believe that these people have to abandon their old ways in their original country and adapt to their adopted country. In this essay, I will argue that it is the first priority task of immigrants to accept both written and unwritten rules in their adopted country. The reasons for this are twofold.",
        "First of all, it is a vital mission for newcomers to know the law in the adopted country. The law protects humans to have basic rights, and it also prohibits some behaviour to maintain social order. An action such as gambling could be allowed in some countries, but it could be a criminal in other countries. If newcomers can know the law of their country well, they can consciously prevent themselves to break the law.",
        "Secondly, newcomers have to respect the social norms of their adopted country for maintaining societal cohesion. As a common saying goes, \u2018When in Rome, do as Romans do.\u2019 Indeed, this is the best way for immigrants to get used to local customs. However, some might refuse to attend local events because they do not accept them at all. Similarly, some local citizens would not accept newcomers and react as xenophobia. This causes a lot of conflicts between them. In this case, people have to learn how to respect each other from different cultures.",
        "In conclusion, possible ways to fit in a new society would be following the law and respecting unwritten rules. I do believe that for better prospects for the future, people should consider what could achieve a better pluralist society."
