The music was very loud and I could easily hear it in my bedroom. It made it very difficult for me to fall asleep. I have to get up at 6 A.M. in order to get to work on time. However, I told her about her noise but she acted rude manner to me that is the worst neighbour I have ever seen.",

        "Thanks in advance for giving the matter your attention.",
