        "Today a lot of people were forced to move to another country. It would happen because of many reasons such as war, poverty, famine and dictatorship. All of these people face a vital obstacle as the language barrier. Let\u2019s consider some pros and cons of it.",
        "The first thing that needs to be said is a serious challenge for every human, who turns out in these circumstances. It is undeniable that speaking a foreign language could improve your brain activity tremendously. The second point of it, living in the country and learning you would know a local language much faster than in your home country. Although, I admit, that there are many more negative sides to this case. For instance, it could be beneficial to the vast majority of the population.",
        "Doubtless, somebody with a poor level of the local language will have some communication issues. Not all people have the pleasure to speak with a person with bad pronunciation. If you have low language skills, then you would meet problems in essential areas of life for instance when you need to get a new passport, to fill out some documents. For example for me, it`s really difficult to begin a romantic relationship in the other country because the most important clue in the relationship is humour, but in order to understand jokes, requires quite a high level of language skills.",
        "To draw the conclusion, one can say that it`s a good experience in anybody's life, trying to live in a country which uses not native language. However, it is up to everyone to choose whether to move abroad or not."
