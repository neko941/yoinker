        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter in regard to the part-time voluntary unpaid work announcement that you have posted in the newspaper last week.",
        "I would like to apply as a volunteer in this museum due to several reasons. One of them is that I have this passion for volunteering for great causes since I believe this establishment has been the source of knowledge for our cultural history which is very close to my heart.  Furthermore, this act of service will allow me to be productive during this summer holidays instead of spending my time binge-watching Netflix or playing video games.",
        "On another hand, I have a variety of skills and qualities that can be valuable to your needs. First & foremost, since I have recently finished my hospitability vocational courses I can serve as a receptionist. Moreover, I have  very good attention to detail which can be essential in cataloguing some documentation or artefacts. Lastly, I truly enjoy doing tour guides which can be helpful to explain some of the stories behind your displays accordingly.",
        "In terms of my availability, I can only be of service during the weekdays for the next 2 months apart from weekends. The reason behind this is that during these days I will need to perform some voluntary work in our church ministries.",
        "I am hoping for your favourable response and looking forward to hearing from you regarding the outcome of my application.",
        "Yours faithfully,"
