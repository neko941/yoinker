        "It is believed that the administration should spend a large sum of money on science tutoring compared to other conventional lessons for the advancement of a country and a subsequent progression. I completely disagree with the statement because of two rock-solid reasons.",
        "First of all, a country\u2019s development does not solely depend on the people who are from a scientific background. Even though they can contribute a lot to the infrastructural development, say, developing high-rise buildings, bridges, and so on but they can not do anything for the business aspects of a country which is also a key area for development. In this case, we need people from business schools, for example, BBA and MBA degrees holder. That\u2019s why the government should give priority not only to the science lesson but also the business lesson in order to develop a progressive nation.",
        "Secondly, a country should also consider cultural advancement when it comes to the question of development. That is to say, an authority should invest more money in subjects that are related to the arts, for instance, dance, music, and many more in order to make a more culturally superior nation. For this reason, all cultural subjects should be samely treated like a science. In a nutshell, the government should equally treat both the subjects from the science and the art background when it comes to the question of investment.",
        "To sum up, it must be said that for the development of a country and to continue its progression the government should equally give priority to other subjects along with science. I guess without doing such, a country can not be advanced."
