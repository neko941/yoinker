        "it is apparent that nowadays young has increasingly subjected to various problems due to parents having less time at home. In this essay, the causes of parents having less time at home and the current problems of teenagers will be discussed in the following paragraphs to support my absolute agreement with this statement.",
        "The first reason which makes parents have limited quality time to spend with their pupil at home compared to old days is working. As they have to commute to the office for generating income to feed their family, they have only a few holidays to spend with their kids. For example, my father has to work 6 days a week from Monday to Saturday, so he has only a day to spend with family. However, in the past, the majority of work that people worked is doing agriculture, so they did not need to work far away from home, and can look after their children during working. Therefore, the change in working trend leads to less relaxed time to stay with offsprings.",
        "Furthermore, there are various types of distractions, which can trigger negative issues among teenagers such as illegal drugs, games, and porn, which were very difficult to face in the past. Because of easy access to this bad stuff, youths can easily become addicted to them  and ruin their future life. For instance, these days, children can watch porn on the internet with just a few clicks, regardless of any controls or punishments. Moreover, they can buy cannabis from  online shopping malls without any checks. Hence, now young can easily lose their future to these harmful things.",
        "In conclusion,  the aforementioned reasons include the modern working lifestyle of parents and more distractions for the young, which can cause disastrous problems for the young. Presumably, I strongly agree that recent children experience more trouble than those in the last decade."
