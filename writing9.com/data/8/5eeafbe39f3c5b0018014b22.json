        "Developing countries, especially in Asia and Africa, need the support of developed nations to escape poverty and improve their economy. Many people think that apart from monetary support, there are various ways to help emerging countries which is essential for a long and steady economic growth. I totally agree with this point of view.",
        "On the one hand, Financial aids are used to solve the present situation rather than a durable development. Developing countries can use the money to pay the debt or giving to needy citizens. However, the root cause of poverty can\u2019t be solved if nations can\u2019t find a way to use the money judiciously. For example, Greece and Venezuela can get rid of debt even they have much support from other countries and organizations.",
        "On the other hand, developed countries can help them in many ways to guide and backing the poorer countries. Firstly, they can help them by transferring their technology to improve the developing nation to catch up with modern technology and raise their productivity. Secondly, multi-national companies from developing countries could invest and place their branch in emerging countries. It creates more jobs for citizens in developed countries, and their companies can expand their market size in other areas. For instance, recently, Apple Inc has placed its factory in Vietnam, which opens more job opportunities for Vietnamese as well as lower Apple\u2019s production cost.",
        "In conclusion, developed countries can help poorer nations by investing and guiding them rather than financial aid. Therefore, poorer countries can have a chance to grow and have a strong economy."
