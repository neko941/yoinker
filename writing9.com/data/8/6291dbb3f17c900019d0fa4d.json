        "It is true that in this modernised world, most people are concerned about shopping. There are some individuals, who assume that buying habits are related to a personage. To my point of view, I strongly agree with this notion because of some evidence.",
        "To begin with, the shopping nature of elders and younger are different like the children prefer the bright colours but the adults take care about fashion. To exemplify, the research conducted by the school in Britain, stated that when a person gets older, he likes  simplicity because our mental power gets disturbed in old age without comforts. As a,result the buying hobby is dependent on the age group.",
        "On the other hand, In adult life we feel healthy and fit and also we want to attract others that is why we sometimes bear pain in order to express ourselves in a beautiful way. Apart from this, at the age of 60,s and 70,s the people are mostly surrounded by some diseases because their bodies feel tired all the time. For instance, In Japan their shopping stores for all ages are different especially for elders, from their point of view, they assume that simple things attract the old ages. Because of this, they advertise only simple products in that stores.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, I believe that the person,s shopping preference is more dependent on life group than any other factors because our mental growth likes the simplicity in the old ages and also, in the adult group we care about modernise culture because in that maturity we feel strong."
