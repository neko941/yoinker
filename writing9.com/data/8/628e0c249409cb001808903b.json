        "Homeschooling families are becoming common in most parts of the world. Many people assume a traditional school is obligatory for all children, whereas some would design their own course of study for their children at home. In this topic, I will highlight reasons why homeschooling is a good choice or a wrong decision.",
        "To begin with, as far as I see, the safety of the school environment is a concern for many modern parents. Nowadays, there is a variety of pupils as victims of school violence. Studying at home provides the children with a flexible schedule as well as eliminates conflicts with their friends at school. Furthermore, the quality of public schools makes mothers and fathers feel not adequate good. Some teachers, for example, are not really spending time educating their pupils. Meanwhile, at home, parents play a role as an instructor that can help their own children approach  knowledge effectively. Specifically, practising with children, in my opinion, is an interesting way to connect the relationship between two generations. Due to the fact that in this rapid developing period, many parents should devote all their time to work, and this leads to a lack of care for their kids.",
        "Notwithstanding the benefits listed above, I deem a formal school is also inevitable. The reason why for this is studying in a conventional classroom equals certificates or qualifications, which we can not receive at home. For instance, if you would to study abroad, you should have a high school diploma. Moreover, despite the violence at school, there are so many children who deserved to make friends. Obviously, friends make the mental lives of the children better.",
        "To sum up, homeschooling has its advantages and also disadvantages. I believe that each family have own manner to educate their children to become helpful people."
