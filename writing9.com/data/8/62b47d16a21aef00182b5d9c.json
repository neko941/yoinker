        "There has been controversy about whether electronic and paper books are more beneficial for students in studying. After the consideration, I believe that both electronic books and printed ones are equally advantageous.",
        "There are several reasons why teenagers have been using e-books in studying in recent years. First, they do not have to carry the actual books in their bags which are heavy and significantly cause back and shoulder pain if they carry for a long time. Meanwhile, electronic books provide a storage function and are capable of accessing the internet by using the smartphone or other gadgets to download any books, and anywhere they like. For instance, when we get stuck in traffic congestion or waiting for the professor arrived. Thus, they can make good use of their time to study.",
        "However, there are many underprivileged students who might not afford to purchase computers or other devices. In some rural areas, they cannot connect to the internet, restricting them from using the paper book and having no other alternatives. Accordingly, working or studying behind the screen for an extended period significant result in some health problem, such as eye strain. Similarly, using a long period of paper in insufficient light might cause a similar illness with e-books.",
        "In conclusion, both e-books and paper-based books are beneficial to student learning; while they are affordable to buy technological devices and have sufficient light, electronic books are a better option. On the other hand, if there are not capable of connecting to the internet, the printed version is an appropriate choice."
