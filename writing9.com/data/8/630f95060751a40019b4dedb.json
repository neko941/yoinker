        "Education plays a vital role in everybody's life. Some communities believe that rewards should be done to the offspring, who have excellent performance in their academics while some other communities argue with this matter and say that rewards should be done to the offspring, who have surged in their academics. In this essay, I will discuss both scenarios and then I will give my opinion on this matter with relevant examples.",
        "On the one side, In every education sector, Higher authorities will encourage their students by awarding them based on their academic results. Most students are utilizing this opportunity to get free education. In this way, talented people in academics will reach their goals with their results and rewards. For instance, In Telangana, some schools are giving free education to  students who get 10 CGPA in the tenth standard. And another good example is, Students who secure EAMCET rank within 10000 then  will get a free seat in BTech Universities.",
        "On the other hand, Students, who are weak in their academics should be encouraged to improve their standards by providing some academic rewards. It is a good way to motivate students in their academic growth. For instance, In my college, I received a merit award for my academics because I improved my percentage from 75% to 85%. And I used this award money for my hostel payment.",
        "To sum up, In my view, I agree with both statements. Because students should be encouraged by rewarding them in their academics because these rewards give motivation to the students and help in improving their results."
