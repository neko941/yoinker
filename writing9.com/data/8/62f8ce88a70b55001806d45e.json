        "Maintaining a well-being lifestyle has become a controversial topic these days. Some believe that it is the duty of the government to supervise the diet of their citizens, while others argue that people should be taken care of their own health. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my final thought on this argument.",
        "On the one hand, the fundamental activity that the government can contribute to is raising awareness of a balanced diet for people in every society by distributing knowledge about its importance through media or any channels. However, in some rural areas, it is undeniable that individuals have limited access to that information; therefore, local authorities should be responsible for educating and reinforcing communities about the practice and essence of a healthy diet. In addition, a collaboration between the government sector, the Ministry of Public health, and other sectors such as schools could attribute to a successful plan. To illustrate, a nutritionist from a school can develop a daily meal plan to ensure that students receive the proper amount of nutrients required per meal and educate the students along with support from officials.",
        "On the other hand, many people still believe that it is an individual\u2019s responsibility to maintain a healthy lifestyle. In other words, if one decides not to follow the practice, nobody else can force to do so; therefore, individuals should learn and select to consume nutritious food for their own benefit. In the present day, there are wide ranges of healthy food offered in a market which allows people to freely choose depending on their interests while still being able to maintain a healthy diet. To illustrate, those who are busy and have no time for  meal preparation can afford healthy processed meals available at a convenience store rather than unhealthy fast food. Another example is that many cafes offer customized beverages that people who are concerned about their diets can choose varieties of healthy alternatives such as low-fat milk and soy milk.",
        "In conclusion, the authority can at least provide knowledge and highlight the advantages of health to their citizen, however, it cannot be a successful approach without actions from them to control their intake. I believe that everyone in society is responsible for nourishing his/her own health condition."
