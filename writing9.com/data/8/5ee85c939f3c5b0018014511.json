        "Some people claim that it is better for youngsters to ask the guidance from the elders than young ones. Personally, I agree that the suggestions from old people are valuable, but I argue that peers\u2019 recommendation has its specific advantages in particular situations. My essay below will clarify for  my point of view.",
        "On the one hand, the lesson from the old can be helpful  due to the vast experiences they accumulated. In my case, for example, when I was in burnout status because of a hectic schedule , the talks with my grandparents helped me alleviate stress and rediscover partly the balance of my life. In addition, young people can learn from the failures of the older ones. In a business context, there is nearly no likelihood that one start-up company could have a certain achievement without consultation from senior people in their field. Getting instruction from seniors prevents the new company from going astray and committing the same mistakes that older people have made.",
        "However, in some aspect, the advice from peers is also significant. Firstly, there is no generation gap between the young so they can understand their mindset of each other more clearly. As a result, they can provide appropriate advice for young people. For instance, the volunteers prefer asking for tips to their love stories from their friends rather than offering it from their parents or the older people. Secondly, some old people did not have opportunities to use science technology. Therefore, their suggestions may be helpless if people ask them about problems related to that.",
        "In conclusion, it is wise to get consultation from the old, but opinions of young ones should be received adequate consideration."
