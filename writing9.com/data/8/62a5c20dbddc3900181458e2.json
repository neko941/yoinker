        "This is regarding the article you published on 20nd May, regarding the town centres, according to which all the town centres in the country look similar. However, I am not in complete support of it.",
        "I agree with you that the central part of the city is crowded and has traffic congestion like all the major cities and it usually gets worse during the evening hours.",
        "However, the centre of my city is different from the other cities in many ways. It has outdoor public seating spaces within every 100m distance for people who need to take some rest. Also, the town centre is built in a circle around a huge community park which is quite accessible from any point which makes the environment friendly.",
        "If you are interested I would be glad to give you a tour of my town in which I can introduce you to many more interesting local things. Along with that, I can also, guide you regarding the historical facts about the place.",
        "Yours Faithfully",
