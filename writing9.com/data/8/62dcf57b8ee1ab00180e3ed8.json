        "Nowadays, numerous urban areas are changing their transportation method,such as from cars to bicycles. In this essay, I will outline the causes of the issue, as well as the comparison between the usage of cars and bicycles.",
        "To begin with, the index of air population in the urban area is likely arisen from time to time for the past few years. It is undeniable that one of the prominent problems comes from  cars. The production of carbon dioxide will menace the air quality in the surrounding area. Furthermore, the cost of utilizing cars might be prohibitive, and not everyone could afford to expense their expenditure that much chiefly, those who are low income. For instance, folks will  not have to bother to think about their transportation costs anymore if they commence implementing  bicycles as their predominant transport.",
        "On the other hand, a section of society holds a belief that cars have more merits to compared  bicycles. However, personally, i opine that there are a plethora of benefits of using  bicycles. For example, bicycles are pollution-free, as well as cheaper than  cars. Therefore, some people prefer to use  bicycles rather than cars as they have a multitude of utilitarian. Nonetheless, the public still turns  blind to this matter as they opine that cars are more comfortable than bicycles.Despite this, it poses only a minor threat to the advantages.",
        "In conclusion, although cars are more comfortable than bicycles, they are not pollution-free. I think the community needs to change their low-class mindset, and opine that bicycles have numerous drawbacks."
