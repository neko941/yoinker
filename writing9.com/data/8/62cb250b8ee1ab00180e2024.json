        "There is a fact that a large number of time teenagers will spend on their smartphones in their daily life. There are various reasons why children are addicted to scrolling on their phones, and I believe there are more drawbacks than benefits.",
        "There are many reasons why young teenagers indulge in the world of smartphones. Firstly, smartphones enable them to log in to those platforms to communicate and interact with their friends when they might don\u2019t have a permit to go out for fun. Applications like Instagram, Snapchat and Telegram allowed young children to stay updated with their peers and share every moment of their own lives easier. Secondly, the content available on smartphones is intentionally designed to be attracting and addicting for those people who don\u2019t have too much self-control, especially teenagers. Self-discipline is a kind of ability children usually don\u2019t have because they don\u2019t have a long time of training. If they are attracted, it is hard to stop.",
        "In my opinion, this phenomenon will have a lot of negative effects on children. A young person who stays in the same place and focuses on a small screen all day may cause unhealthy results such as myopia and spine disease. Meanwhile, students\u2019 performance in school in their subject can also be affected if valuable study time were taken by social media and mobile games. Having such an unhealthy body and bad grades will damage a child\u2019s future development.",
        "In conclusion, teenagers, who need friends and can\u2019t have self-control, may be addicted to smartphones, and it will have a negative effect on their future prospects."
