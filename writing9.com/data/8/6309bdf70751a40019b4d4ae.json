        "I am writing to complain about the extremely loud noise that the construction workers and machines are making near where I live.",
        "I understand this is a major building which will bring about several benefits to our town. As far as I am aware, the new building will give place to a whole set of new fashion stores, restaurants and a coffee shop. Many members of the community have shown how very pleased they are about this situation, however, I cannot say the same for myself.",
        "Despite the fact that much of this issue occurs during weekday working hours, I have to work from home every other Friday of the week. I have been having difficulties focusing while at work and important video conferences have had to get cancelled for the excruciating noise. I see why most neighbours have not complained, since they are away while the construction machines operate, however, I cannot keep on coping with such a disturbance",
        "I would kindly ask if you could switch up the tradesman's day off to Fridays, so I make sure I can fulfil my tasks on that specific day. I hope you can understand how I have suffered this inconvenience and can do something regarding this matter.",
        "I would hope you could resolve this pressing issue promptly.",
