        "Nowadays, most people believe that holding a global sporting program is important for a nation. For many people, especially government officials, the chance to host a worldwide event is an attractive one. However, there are pros and cons to doing this. In this essay, I will discuss both the advantages and drawbacks of having such an important event.",
        "To begin with, the opportunity to host an international event attracts foreign investors and boosts the country\u2019s tourism. The hosting of international sporting activities attracts people from different countries, this boosts the economy because there would be a lot of foreign exchange and investors would love to create jobs as well. Also, most people visiting the country for the first time would visit most tourist centres. For example, in the year Ghana hosted the AFCON, there was a lot of income from the tourism ministry which is indicative of a boost in the economy.",
        "In contrast, there are some drawbacks too. In some instances, government officials waste a lot of money on the planning and hosting of such an event. This leads to a strain on the government purse. In as much as it brings foreign exchange because of corruption on the part of the organizers, it can be detrimental. For instance, even though there was an increase in the government\u2019s purse when Ghana hosted the AFCON, most money could not be accounted for.",
        "In conclusion, hosting an international event is not easy. There is the need to weigh the benefits such as the attraction of foreign investors and an improvement in the tourism centre and the cons such as embezzlement of funds. In my opinion, the benefits outweigh the disadvantages."
