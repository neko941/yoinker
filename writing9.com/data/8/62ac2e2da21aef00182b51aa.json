        "While some people believe that movies can be watched on smartphones or tablets without going to the cinema, others take the view that they can enjoy  if they see films in a movie theatre. In this essay, I will explain both these points of view.",
        "On the one hand, there are nations that take the view that people can easily catch the movies in their own places with the help of advanced electronic gadgets. In other words, people can buy many kinds of streaming service applications to catch all kinds of flicks on their phones or tablets. For example, Netflix, one of the famous streaming services, offers films or other television and updated movies can be watched from that application and folk don\u2019t need to go to the cinema. In addition, they can download and keep the film that they want to see on their gadgets so that films can be watched many times.",
        "On the other hand, others believe that movies should be watched in a movie theatre in order to get full enjoyment. Getting enjoyment from the theatre and on gadgets are different because people can see the movie on a big screen that cannot be achieved from electronic devices and the sound system and the dark atmosphere of the theatre make folk more exciting and more romantic. For instance, most couples are used to dating at first to go to the cinema to get more pleasure on their first date. Moreover, some latest films are only shown in theatre before they were uploaded on steaming services or on online media. Therefore, folk can catch the latest movies only in the cinema.",
        "To conclude, although watching a film in a cinema can give full an enjoyment to the audience, I think that people can get more benefits and pressure by seeing movies on their electronic devices as it is less costly and can watch all kinds of movies on their own places."
