        "It is true that taking risks in people\u2019s lives is vital to achieving a successful life. Nevertheless, tasking risks in people\u2019s lives has some drawbacks, this essay will argue that the advantages do outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "To begin with , taking risks may result may hazards in whole life because people might not solve some hazardous problems. For example, investing a significant amount of money for an own business without enough strategies or experience might lead to both unemployed and bankruptcy at the same time if the business failed ,unfortunately. In addition, a person who had failures in his/her life will lose  self-confidence in future.",
        "However, there are many advantages, taking chances can lead to getting a better opportunity. For instance, some ventures can bring a person to get a successful life, therefore, people will never know the results without venturing into something or chances. Furthermore, risk-taking can also support people to become more tolerant and the better ways how the solve  difficulties in their lifelong. Moreover, people will have abilities to solve  risky problems without fearless and they might improve their self-confidence level and resilience because of taking hazardous chances.",
        "To sum up, although there is no doubt there are some disadvantages associated with taking risky chances, I believe that the benefits clearly outweigh the drawbacks. Despite the fact that people might face a lack of confidence or be unemployed, resilience and improving self-confidence will be useful in their whole life. Given this situation, it is recommended that people should take risks to get a better successful life."
