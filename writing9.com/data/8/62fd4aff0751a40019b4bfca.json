        "Recent years have witnessed that manufacturing factories create pollution in the atmosphere are increasing. Many support the idea of increasing taxes would reduce  air pollution while others think that other methods are more beneficial to creating  better air quality. In this essay, I will take part in both views and share my opinion afterwards.",
        "To begin with, applying higher tax rates to those companies which use chemicals and materials those take a long time to disappear  to produce goods can be one good way of reducing pollution. Most factories throw used and remaining chemicals into the rivers and oceans thus, it has a huge negative impact on water creatures. Paying extra taxes could be a reason for factories to create new ways to re-use the materials they had already used.",
        "On the other hand, alternative ways can be considered such as charging fewer taxes on factories which use green energy. This method can be beneficial for factories, people all over the world and especially the atmosphere. Industries which use green energy may lower the polluted air created by the manufacturing process. Moreover, the government can invest more in scientific projects that control emission output. For example, there are many people complaining about the lack of fresh air as they wait for the government to conduct an action. Investing more money into projects encourages the scientists to spend more time and have good experimental analysis on solving the pollution issues.",
        "To conclude, I believe it may not be a good decision to increase the charges, since each company tries to maximize its profit. This can be used as a last method while it may create enough problems for factories. I firmly believe that other methods could be more beneficial to reduce pollution created by industries."
