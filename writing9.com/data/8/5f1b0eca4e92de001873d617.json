        "In several nations\u2019 adolescents are supported to have some jobs or travel for one year between graduating high school and starting university studies. This essay will first demonstrate that young people can have a new perspective of the horizon as an advantage, followed by an analysis of the diminishing of study motivation on the younger after one year travel or work as a negative impact.",
        "Firstly, the adolescent who stop enrolling in the university may find out the novelty perspectives for the resting year. In fact, both travelling and working can provide a person some various experiences, such as learn to co-operate with others while working or learn some different cultures at different places while travelling. Nevertheless, it can lead one to have a mature minded and some useful experiences that help for confronting the upcoming world by themselves. A recent study found that student who did not immediately starts their university studies have gained lots of interesting views and they seem to be much more mature than others because of the experiences they had.",
        "On the other hand, there is also a negative impact on this situation. The younger might have less motivation to start studying after a year of travelling or working. In fact, they might already adapt into the lifestyle which they did not have to study in school. Besides, the adolescent will be uncomfortable to have restrictions in school again while there was no limitation when they travelled. A recent research found that students who did not intake to university, they mostly decided to continue working instead of study.",
        "In conclusion, there are two kinds of aspects of young people are encouraged to work or travel after they graduated from high school and before entering the university. Having a different or wiser perspective can improve one\u2019s thoughts, but they must be aware of getting less motivation to have higher education which would better help them in their specific industry in the future."
