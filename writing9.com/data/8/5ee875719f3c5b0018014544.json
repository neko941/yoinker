        "People believe that nowadays there are many people who tend to work out at the sport facilities as they are living a healthy life as a trend. Despite the number of those that are available, more and more people tend to have lack activities during the day. This essay will discuss the problems that might arise as well as solutions to ensure a healthy lifestyle.",
        "There are several problems related to a behaviour which has less physical activity. Firstly, most people will gain some weight when there is no significant physical activity throughout the day. Indonesia Health Department has published the fact that people who does not practice small exercise such as jogging or walking for 2 hours per week has higher possibility to suffer from many diseases. In Indonesia, for example, this lifestyle lead to issues like obesity and diabetes. Secondly, the internet has become integral part of human\u2019s life as well as their effects on health. People tend to be more comfortable to spend most of their time to watch series on YouTube or Googling something. This attitude has become habit; hence it would keep people from being productive, but to log on all day. This will also contribute to another disease such as worsen eyesight and back pain. In addition, it separates us from the real relationship among people as well.",
        "In my opinion, there are some solutions to ensure a healthy lifestyle. The first solution is self-commitment to get small workout minimum 30 minutes a day. In my opinion, small exercise as simple as walking to the office or short distance can burn calories and make our body healthier. Furthermore, a study done by the Indonesian Health Ministry said that one who has done small exercise tend to be happier and more motivated to live the life. The second solution is trying to be more productive. Indeed, it can be started from scheduling daily activity from small workout for 30 minutes in the morning until bedtime. Moreover, we can start to use the internet wisely which can keep us from wasting time, therefore, we can do many things like outdoor activity instead of sitting all the time in front of the laptop watching video on the internet or chatting. Get ourselves to be used to outdoor activity and interact with people also will enhance both our physical and mental health.",
        "In conclusion, modern behaviour can give bad impacts such as trigger some diseases and make people less productive. However, there are some positive things that can be done to ensure a healthy lifestyle."
