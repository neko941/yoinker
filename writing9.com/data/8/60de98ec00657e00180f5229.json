        "It is believed by certain people that the state should invest its revenue in essential facilities like education and health care.However, arts are not a significant sector where the government should waste its money.In my opinion , I completely agree with this perspective as they have a higher priority rank in the Hierarchy table as compared to arts which can be get from other sources.",
        "Firstly, the predominant reason why many people advocate that official funds should be better invested in other sectors like education or health care as compared to arts is that people involved in these careers such as actors, singers and dancers earn an exorbitant amount of money by arranging concerts, shows, movies and from business entrepreneurs.In this context, due to their huge fan-following, even if their movies flop at box- offices , they still manage to benefits a  lot from them. In addition , they are also involved in promotion ads where they are used by various business entrepreneurs to advertise their products and in ,return they again make a lot of money due to the fact that they are well-known personalities and public figures.While hospital and ,education fields put extreme pressure on the general public for its services.",
        "Moving further, various private organisations also support and sponsor people in these professions by organizing shows where people can volunteer in them.For example, shows like Indian Idol which was a singing shows and was sponsored by various companies like Adidas, Fortune oil, Canola oil, and Airtel. In other words, these kinds of shows has never any scarcity of funds and the companies also make sure that these programs should be hosted by well-known personalities to increase the TRP of the show.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that to support art and craft distinct alternatives are present but sectors like health care and education need more attention and financial support from authorities."
