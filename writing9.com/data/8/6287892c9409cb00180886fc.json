        "One of the most conspicuous trends of today,s world is a colossal upsurge in the number of people who believe that more and more business training and business meeting are  getting more broadly in the pace of working platform. Here, I will  the articulated points of view of the pros and cons regarding the online meetings which are highly preferred.",
        "There is a widespread worry that this will only lead to a myriad of concerns in the people,s life who are fully involved in the online meetings rather than in person, additionally, there are few advantages in the  different ways as people can save a lot of time if they are saving the time of travel and other expenditures meanwhile in-person meeting. For instance, since covid-19 has spread out in the world, employees are doing most of their term online schedule and they are using other occasions for other chores which are quite helpful in the family as a good assistance. Besides, online office assembly, are helpful in the time savings and environmental contribution to the air pollution and noise pollution.",
        "Furthermore, on the other side, there are a few disadvantages as well along with advantages, as workers are not having teamwork altogether and they are deprived of a few skills and not capable to have a good relationship among staff. Moreover, sometimes employees cannot make a pace of work and make others understand as they can do in-person meetings. For example,  research has been conducted in Japan that the business gets more progress which expertise do more gatherings at the office rather than digitalized.",
        "In the conclusion, in  view of the arguments outlined above, it can be observed that it  totally depends on the organisation which way they get more benefits the way they do conferences."
