        "I have been accepted to join the Masters of Science programme in the winter semester at your college. I am supposed to meet you in an interview next Monday morning, but I am afraid the timing contradicts another important meeting. I am hoping that you would allow me to meet you sometime later on that day or on a different day.",
        "I work with Optus Telecom and they have scheduled a general meeting on 27th November which contradicts my interview with you. The meeting in the office will start at 9.00 am whereas my interview with you set at 10.00 am on the same day. I understand how important it is for me to meet you to finalise my admission and hoping that you would allow me to alter the timing as I really cannot make it at 10 am on 27th November.",
        "I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and I request you to kindly reschedule my interview for another day or after 2 pm on the same day. For this, I shall always be thankful to you. Also, kindly let me know if I need to take any test as part of the interview process and how long the interview might continue.",
