        "In this contemporary era, most individuals are highly conscious about their studies and they continuously opt to study  abroad. Because of this, this content becomes more debatable. In this essay, by analysing the possible aspects prons will overcome the cons.",
        "To begin, with the main advantages of going to a foreign country for education. Firstly, It is widely common that most adults in foreign places have to stay without families and do a part-time job. The biggest benefit is that at an adult age they know  how to earn money and this thing forces them to study harder and get a professional job. Secondly, Some professions do not have a better scope in the motherland. So, that is why the students turn their heads to the second country. For instance, 19% of people in Canada are from India and they say that they earn more than better revenue in Canada rather than in India.As a result, this trend opens new opportunities for people.",
        "On the other hand, to concern related to the opposite point, Some students want to go to another state just to get freedom obviously this would lead to the destruction of life.In addition, most pupils after studying at abroad universities lost a chance to serve their homeland. Furthermore, without knowing anything like culture,jobs,even road and stay on ourselves, as this is not only difficult but also dangerous.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, I believe that choosing to study in other lands for better and more satisfying life has more merits than its demerits."
