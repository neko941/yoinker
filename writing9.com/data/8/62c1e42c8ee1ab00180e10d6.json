        "Nowadays, many universities offer online learning to their students. Undoubtedly, it is a tremendous opportunity for those individuals who are working full-time or living in remote areas, although fewer are sceptical about its benefits. However, some believe that online study is not better than campus learning. I agree with this because of that online study can not be a substitute for campus education. Online education is far away from virtual study.",
        "There are multitude causes to attend university classes. First of all, the university atmosphere gives its students a proper learning environment that we never obtain in online education. The other thing who wants to be a master in a particular subject, group discussion is a more vital aspect of research projects. Thus, insight would be more beneficial. Secondly, in class, the teachers give proper attention to the students. Indeed, students can direct queries to the teachers if they feel any obstacles with any master\u2019s subjects. All these things are not possible in online learning, where the computer program will merely lecture and move on to the next lesson regardless of whether the student has learned the previous one or not. Needless to say, researchers explore that those who attend campus lectures are more knowledgeable rather than online learning students.",
        "Of course, an online study has many granted which are undeniable for example, for those people who are living in rural or isolated areas and not able to attend classes, online learning is beneficial for them. But they cannot ignore the disadvantages of online study. For instance, they do not have a mentor to ask about their performance and practical in a laboratory is another important which they never have in an online course.",
        "To conclude, I fully agree with campus education, which is far better than online courses, because the atmosphere at the campus is conducive to learning and interactions, on the campus student with invaluable interpersonal skills."
