        "Last Wednesday, I visited your branch in Kitchener. I was impressed by the features of the recent invention  of the television. The customer service representative whose name is Yash Patel helped me with the whole process of buying including the introduction of television, billing, and delivery. I believe that the sound system is not  working properly  as mentioned during the time of purchase. It feels like this television is not worth it.",
        "I informed the main branch to solve the problem. The main branch asked me to send you the invoice for the product and request letter. I am attaching both mentioned documents with this email and hope that you will take an action as soon as possible by sending me a new television of replacement.",
        "I look forward to hearing back from you soon.",
