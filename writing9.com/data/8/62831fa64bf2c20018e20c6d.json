        "Although such topics in all likelihood never will yield a consensual agreement, the constructive dialogue on the computer as the best invention leads to thought-provoking discussions. In the last few decades, there have been huge advancements in the field of science and the biggest of all of them I believe is the invention of computers. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of this major advancement.",
        "There are several reasons for my stance, First and foremost, the biggest advantage of this technological advancement  is that it helps the world connect and share information in different ways. This is due to the fact that computers these days are highly advanced and can connect different people from all over the globe without being physically together. For example,  the research conducted by the department of Australian society also reflects on similar lines, and therefore, it can be said that the proposition is convincingly justified. This has resulted in many new electronic innovations and even medical cures. Hence, as mentioned above computer is one of the top innovations.",
        "Secondly, another significant reason for computers to be of extreme importance is that it has replaced less skilful jobs. This is because now computers use artificial intelligence to make machines which are replacing lower-skill jobs. For instance, the implementation of automated check-out counters at the supermarkets, which have eliminated the need for human services for low skill jobs. This has resulted in benefiting the businesses as these machines do not need any holiday or sick leave. Thus, in a nutshell, the aforementioned discussion justifies my stance.",
        "In conclusion, I still believe computers are the major advancement compared to antibiotics and aeroplanes due to the aforementioned multitude of benefits."
