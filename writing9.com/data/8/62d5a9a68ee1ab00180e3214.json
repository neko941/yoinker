        "I am writing to gather more information about the historical exhibition which will be held in your town next month. I am planning to bring a group of students as part of their university project. I heard you are the organizer of the event, therefore I hope you could give me more details about it.",
        "Firstly, could I know the dates it will be held and the agenda for each day ? We will be coming all the way from Ottawa which is a two-hour drive from Clariford, therefore we want to be clear about the time we should leave from there and at what time we should ask our driver to come back to pick us up. Secondly, could it be possible to arrange a tour guide ? My students are very keen on learning about all the statues, therefore I hope you could arrange us a guide. Finally, Could I know the ticket prices and could it be possible to get a discount ? At the moment, fifty students have confirmed their participation.",
        "I would like to finalize everything by next week, therefore I would appreciate it if you could reply at your earliest convenience.",
