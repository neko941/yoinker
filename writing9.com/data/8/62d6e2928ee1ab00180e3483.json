        "In modern-day interviews, it is now common to see companies asking candidates to share their personal details like civil status, hobbies, personal interests, etc. It is constantly argued whether this information is relevant or irrelevant in the process of selecting a successor. According to my knowledge, it is okay to share these things under a certain mutual understanding between the requestor and the giver. This essay will analyze both views about this affirmation and the reason for my personal opinion.",
        "On the one hand, if a job seeker shares his or her soft skills with the employer, he or can use those to shortlist an ideal candidate to fulfil his requirement. For instance, if a company is in  search of a sales representative, it would be perfect to select a person who possesses skills such as self-motivation, team player, etc. An individual who has done sports along with his academics might have these qualities with him, other than an individual who has done only the relevant paper qualification. So in this case, it is  very easy for the interviewer to go through the list of CVs to identify who has done both sports and studies.",
        "On the other hand, these personal details can be used against the job seeker by the respective organization. For example, civil status, ethnicity, and age might affect  personal to disqualify an applicant from a job vacancy. In some ,countries women get lost their chance of selection, just because of being married. Moreover, I have known some occasions where the religion of a person matters in certain occupations. It is totally unfair for the candidates if the companies select their employees based on these kinds of data.",
        "To sum ,up my writing though there are negative impacts of sharing certain interests, it is always good to share information if it prompts us to do so. However, there should be rules and regulations  in other ,words there should an agreement between the two parties to protect those data and also prohibiting false usage."
