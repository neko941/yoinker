        "In today's era, the youngsters prefer to live with their families after their degree from college, university or after getting jobs in the firms. This trend is followed by some countries. This essay will Articulate its advantages and disadvantages in the following paragraphs with a logical conclusion. In my ,opinion the advantages of graduates staying with their parents outweigh the disadvantages.",
        "To commence with, there are myriad of merits which will wither explain this argument but the most preponderant advantage is that they can help their family with their financial income as it helps to decrease the burden of their parents Moreover, if all members of the family contribute the salary in household expense, it will help them save money. For instance, my friend Prit working in a multinational company after graduating from university decided to reside with their parents which helped them a lot to save money and although they contribute their salary for the daily household items. Besides this, another pivotal aspect Of this argument is that the relationship bond between parents and their child increases  day by day as youngsters share their emotions, happiness and bad times with their parents. Moving further, Rather than  live independently they choose their family because they love family more than freedom. For example countries like India, the youngsters usually reside with their loved ones rather than spending time alone.",
        "On the other hand, there are a plethora of drawbacks of living with their parents because youngsters are mostly dependent on their family members. Explaining further, the teenagers have to ask  permission every time from their family members. It is difficult for adults. According to the survey in the Times of India, 80% of the youngsters depend on their parents for every decision Hence, it is apparent why many are against this trend.",
        "In conclusion, although there are few demerits of staying with their families. While I believe that residing with parents is more beneficial for the young ones."
