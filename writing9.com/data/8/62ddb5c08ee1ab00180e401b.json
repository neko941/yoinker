        "A section of  society is of  the opinion that organisations have social duties in relation  to the making of profit.I totally concord with this view because  it is the responsibility of companies to build social amenities and create awareness.This essay will explain the reasons for my stances with examples in the subsequent paragraphs.",
        "To begin  with,one of the most compelling reasons for agreeing with this view is the construction of social amenities by an organisation.The construction of schools and  hospitals will make citizens  access to good health care and education.The government can not take the sole obligation alone.For example,the construction of the hospital in  my village has reduced the mortality rate by 90% according to a recent survey by Ghana Health Service.Therefore,Businesses can help save a lot of lives by building more    health centres to ease the burden on the government.",
        "Secondly,another reason for agreeing with this view is the creation of mass education.It is the duty of companies to create awareness to educate the public about their product and health issues.Giving  information about their services through  the use of radio and television advertisements will help boost their profit margins.Moreover,education about current health problems is the duty of an organisation,For ,example during the Convid pandemic era ,organisations were educating the public about handwashing to prevent them from contracting the disease.Hence,it help the inhabitants from contracting covid 19 virus and saved a lot of lives.",
        "In conclusion,  building  hospitals and schools and educating the public is also the obligation of businesses as well as making a profit.This is the reason why I opine totally to this opinion."
