        "In the contemporary world, If people cannot take risks to do something different from normal people, they are not able to survive in this world. Nowadays, taking danger very crucial thing for people in their routine life as well as in job location. I agreed with this statement  because taking prospects leads to accomplishment in the future as well as gaining knowledge about various fields.",
        "First of all, all things should be enrolled in the competition. People can take uncertainty in their job location to use something distinctive method to complete tasks earlier. In addition, people can take critical decisions in their future as well as learn about various things and parameters that affect  these tasks. For example, businessmen take risks to change their products in terms of design perspective and performance basis. If this product succeeds, then not only learn about the success of the product but also acknowledge several pieces of stuff which help them to implement  other products and provide more reliable services to their customers.",
        "On the contrary, people do not take risks in their personal as well as professional lives. People might be thinking about the failure of their decisions. So, they spend their leisure time doing regular work instead of taking prospects to change their life. Such as, although people are well educated and aware of recent situations in the world; they are not willing to take the prospect of changing their field of job to other sectors. They believe that, if they will not succeed in a particular field; they cannot face that situation.",
        "To conclude, people can take danger in their daily life for the sake of a better future. They are not aiming only for benefit but also to learn about various things in depth."
