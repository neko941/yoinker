        "Whether a child should have the freedom to make mistakes or not has been a matter of discussion amongst people and parents. While parents\u2019 protective instincts do have their benefits, I believe that letting children choose their own paths and learn from their own mistakes is the better parenting method.",
        "There are two main reasons why parents want to protect their children from making mistakes. Firstly, parents should understand that kids are too young to distinguish right from wrong, as a guardian, adults\u2019 advice and supervision for their children are needed. Secondly, parents have the responsibility to make sure their children do things right. For example, nowadays children are exposed to everything through social media, computers, etc. easy access to information through the internet allows them to read and view things that are not appropriate for their age. If parents do not stop their children\u2019s behaviour in time, their children\u2019s academic performance will be affected, or even worse, sink into gangs which consequently render them off the right life track and they may commit crimes.",
        "In spite of the above arguments, I support the opinion that parents should enable children to have some freedom to make mistakes. When a child makes mistakes, they see the consequences of their actions. As long as young individuals are well-instructed, they are highly likely to learn from their mistakes, to tell all factors into consideration before making decisions and to reflect upon and correct themselves. In this way, they will establish their own judgment, which is really an important process in life. For example, when a child fails a test because they didn\u2019t study for it, they can take the natural consequence and choose to be better prepared next time.",
        "In conclusion, I can understand why parents have a tendency to prevent their children to make mistakes, but it seems to me that children should overall learn to be responsible for their own decisions."
