        "On the other hand, there are some drawbacks of online media. Older generation people are not comfortable in reading e-papers, as compared to print media. In other words, as elderly people have plenty of free time, so they read all the news very carefully. Whereas, e-papers provides the highlight of current news happening around the world rather than smaller news articles, which print media usually cover. Furthermore, to access online media it is a must to have an internet connection because without internet people have to rely on normal newspapers. For example, in smaller cities, people still do not have an internet connection because of high charges, so people have to depend on print media.",
        "In conclusion, while there are several positive aspects of having an online media such as easy accessibility, convenient. However, it is not easily accessible to all age groups as well as it requires a large expense of installing the internet and device."
