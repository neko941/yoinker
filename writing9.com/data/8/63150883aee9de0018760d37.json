        "Children are raised by various beliefs in different parts of the world. Many people make children believe that anything can be achievable by trying hard. Although expressing this idea has some benefits, it can be harmful if it is not planned properly.",
        "To begin with, one of the most advantages of encouraging children to work hard is that they can choose a purpose for their lives and try to reach it. Hence, since they have a particular goal, nothing can stop them. Another positive point in arousing children\u2019s effort is that they utilize a great amount of energy in order to achieve their ultimate aim. That is to say, time-consuming tasks are prohibited. A good example of this would be professional athletes who have begun their profession from childhood and continue their exercise with a significant amount of effort and perseverance.",
        "Turning to the other side of the argument, the major drawback of raising a child with this idea is that it can ruin their adulthood. Many children may follow their childhood purpose passionately, but when it becomes true it seems worthless. At this point, the dream that has been kept for a long time has been demolished and following this people can be depressed. Another issue is that children should be kept away from adulthood's stressful life. By forcing them to try hard to reach the destination they not only face  too much stress but also, cannot enjoy the route. A third problem is that due to lacking  adequate knowledge and experience children may not be able to choose their goals wisely, so most of the time they have to continue their family\u2019s desires. For instance, imagine adults who have studied whole their life to be a doctor because it was their parent's dream, and now they feel hopeless and do not have an interest in the job.",
        "All things considered, life is challenging and achieving  everything we thrive cannot be possible. we have to weigh up the pros of trying hard and tolerating the tough situation from childhood and cons of arousing stress in a child\u2019s life and also fortify the purpose in their minds which they might not prefer it. Personally, I think we have to assign enough time in order to purposes have been chosen by mature children and try to teach them how to make balance and enjoy their life."
