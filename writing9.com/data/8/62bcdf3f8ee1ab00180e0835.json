        "The first thing I would like to mention is about the staff. The teachers were friendly with students and give practical knowledge in detail. Moreover, I would greatly appreciate the practical labs of an educational institute which allow students to do lab practice any time in a week.",
        "I am greatly thankful for enhancing my culinary skills in me. Since I have joined this subject I learnt  north Indian as well other cuisines like Italian food. At present , I am working in a five-star hotel as a chef.",
        "I would be thankful if you could take my advice for a new course in your school. At present, schools are providing practical labs for Indian and Italian food but it would be great if the learning academy had a Chinese food course because at present this course is in demand.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
