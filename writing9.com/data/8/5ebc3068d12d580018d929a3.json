        "Globalization has culminated in a boom in international tourism, followed by the establishments of series of shopping centre recently. Against this backdrop, however, a host of local businesses has been forced into shutdown. From my personal perspective, despite lucrative benefits, the downsides of this development outweigh its upsides.",
        "In the first place, the opening of malls serves as a leverage in the influx of tourists. Indeed, grand shopping complexes are generally comprised of famous global brands, along with shops and stalls that local inhabitants rent to sell souvenirs and delicacies. With such diversity in merchandise and services, these centres are bound to magnetize a substantial inflow of visitors, who desire to acquire a taste of exclusive luxury and cultural familiarity. For example, in a small city like Nam Dinh, since huge complexes such as Nam Dinh centre or Big C was constructed, the place has witnessed a growing number of tourists from other provinces all the year round.",
        "On the other hand, numerous household businesses are confronting financial difficulties because of major shopping centres. Although a growth in tourism brings bonanzas to the destination, the majority of revenues come into the hands of commercial tycoons rather than native residents. For instance, opulent casinos in Sihanoukville, Cambodia are built on the premise of the city's economic development.  In reality, the head companies monopolize the local economy, depriving Cambodian's restaurants or pottery-makers of their livelihood. Even if local manufactures are permitted to sell their products in shopping malls, the chances of fiscal deficits are still looming on account of fierce competition from top brands and extortionate rentals.",
        "In conclusion, though shopping centres are a real magnet for finances, which would promote the regional economy, it deals a heavy blow to the start-up dreams of the locals. When their life is not guaranteed, the aforementioned trend should be worrying enough to he taken into careful consideration."
