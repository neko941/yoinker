I would like to be considered for the position you are offering because I love being with little ones. Although  I have never been to Australia, I have heard a lot about it and I do not want to miss this opportunity.",

Apart from being friendly and caring, I have a special connection with children which makes my job more enjoyable. Therefore, I am confident that I would be a suitable candidate for providing care to your child.",
