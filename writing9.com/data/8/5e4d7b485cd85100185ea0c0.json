        "With regards to our room requirements and the prices, we would like to reserve two double rooms for four members of our family. Furthermore, I would like to ask for confirmation of your hotel\u2019s rates during the weekend so that there are no unpleasant surprises. You see, we have experienced some hotels which double their rates on weekends.",
        "Finally, if you can also suggest to us some particularly unique sightseeing or local activities that we can participate in that would make our day. We are particularly interested in entertainment for the kids.",
