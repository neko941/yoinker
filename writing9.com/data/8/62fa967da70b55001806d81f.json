        "It's considered by some people that, it's better for the kid to be bred by his extended family rather than his parents alone. In my opinion, I partly agree with this, I think involving the extended family will weaken the child's character, which is a disadvantage, but on the other hand, it will help the parents to teach the young kid the values of the family and  good behaviour and count as an advantage.",
        "Firstly, with regard to the disadvantages, involving the extended family will weaken the personality of the youth, that the kid will take orders from different people and his  age will not help him to distinguish between who should take his words and who  not, and also might result in miss understanding, that every old person can give the order to the younger. he will try to give order by himself and give birth to a bully character. for instance, a study showed that 56% of the kids who has  many older people  upbringing ,  grow to be bullies too, by trying to take control over the  ones younger.",
        "secondly, any family have its values, and when the child grows in an environment giving him the same knowledge, this would be very helpful for the parents as they will not have to keep their eyes on their kids always, and their families will help them to do it. For example, if there is a family which doesn't eat red meat for religious reasons  if his mam and dad become absent from him and left him with grandparents who have the same beliefs. they will feel safe letting him behind.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that involving families in upgrading the children has drawbacks as well as benefits, families ensure the values will be passed from one generation to another  but also might build a bully."
