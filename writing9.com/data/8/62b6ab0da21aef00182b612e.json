        "Dear Sir,",
        "I, Kuljeet Kaur, resident of Ambala city, writing this letter to you to lodge a complaint regarding the loss of an item during my journey from Ambala to Delhi.",
        "Last Monday, I had started my journey from the city railway station and I was carrying a laptop during that time. It was of black colour having a grey tag on its back and of brand Acer. This device belongs to my official property and contains office records as well as data.",
        "I remember when I board the train, it was lying beside me. Before reaching the destination place I had seen it. As I was carrying a lot of luggage, due to that I forget to pick up the laptop and left it behind.",
        "After that when I was travelling to my home then I realised that my laptop is not with me. I need to hand over this device to my office as it has all the mandatory information pertaining to our organization. Therefore, I request you to please ask the staff to locate it and hand it over to the station and make a call to me, so that I can collect it from there.",
        "Look forward to hearing a positive reply from your side.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
        "Kuljeet Kaur."
