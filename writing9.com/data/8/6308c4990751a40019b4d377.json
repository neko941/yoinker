        "It is undeniable that both parents and schools play an indisputable role in fostering juveniles. although  some people believe that just parents should emphasize  nurturing kids in order to be  great citizens ,some proponents argue that institutions are responsible for the development of children's personalities. In this essay, we will discuss both views while providing a plausible conclusion.",
        "First and foremost,while householders should consider the primary needs of offspring that lead to  healthy development,they ought to be cautious about attaining adequate attitudes like reliability,responsibility and emphatically treatment through peers at home before entering society. For instance\u066b students who are learning imperial skills before school.would not only be more prepared for future issues but also could construct more proper relationships with their mentors along with friends therefore they would be more successful.",
        "On the other hand, an educational corporation's role in handling youngsters is crucial when they are responsible for promoting intellectual and interpersonal skills correspondingly means they play a complementary role in youth's future while they are spending the majority of their time in educational institutions therefore,toddlers are flourished by the community of academics.moreover,kids would not be accepted in companies as a worker ao could not be able to build up a career without any university diploma or approval certificate . For example,pupils would fulfil their life dream to be effective and functional with the comparison of instructors.",
        "To sum up, both families and colleges play an important role in teaching individuals to gain both sociological and scientific knowledge in order  to be successful in their adulthood. hence parents give the rudimentary skills while followings contaminated the fostering process appropriately."
