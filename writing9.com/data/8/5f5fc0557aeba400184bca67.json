        "There is no doubt that having an imbalanced work-life  would create a lot of frictions  in both personal and professional life.  Lack of family moment and failure to focus the company aim are the two side-effects of this,: however, this can be effectively managed by adopting a set of strategies.",

This is because they may fail to offer a good amount of point for their loved ones. Eventually, they would rarely resiprocate with their responsibility towards his home. For example,  medical practioners frequently connected to their office as they have multiple level of commitments, which may not be understood by his family. This unrest may impact on the career of an individual since he gets a lot of pressure from the personal affairs.",
        "However, this scenario may be changed significantly, if they stick on  a plan of action that can manipulate the above- mentioned issues. Firstly, create a to do list based on the urgency and try  to ensure these are completed hour boundly.  Additionally, choose the employer who encourages to have  a family hour and allow to stay completely away fromthe work, during weekends and holidays. For instance, there are many world- renowned employers offer this facility  to their staff since they are aware that this occasion can act as energy booster after returning from home.",
        "In conclusion,  keeping a strong family bonding would enhace the performance of the staff.  While lack of emotional bonding and marrital issues can be found in professionals' personal life, when they could not look after them, by following a plan, these hurdles can be overcomed."
