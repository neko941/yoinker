        "It is argued that the best thing which can bring people together regardless of their nationalities and ages is music. In this essay, I am going to discuss  this view and in the end, I will give my own opinion by providing relevant examples.",
        "On the one hand, there are several nostalgic music or national music that all people of a country listen to those. If anywhere play those songs, all people dance with them regardless of their age and enjoy the song. On the contrary, there are some music genres that belong to special groups. For example, rock and roll, rap, and pop are interesting for teenagers or youth while the elderly like to listen to some traditional or classic music.",
        "On the other hand, nowadays some English songs or Latin music are very popular among all nations and dance with those at their parties. Also, for a number of singer concerts, such as Celine Dion and Jennifer Lopez, there are people with various cultural backgrounds and without language barriers that just dance together because of the music. However, there is some music which is special for a part of the world and culture and other nations cannot even listen to it. For example, the Australian ethnic has religious music which plays with a special instrument and other nations even cannot listen to that because do not have pleasant sounds.",
        "In conclusion, although there are some genres that are for just a culture or a generation, I think music can help people of different nationalities or different generations can connect to each other and have a good time despite all their differences."
