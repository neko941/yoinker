        "It is often argued that a young person should gain knowledge on how to cook, while others opposed that it should be learned after they reach the adulthood. However, I believe that is is significant to acquire skills in preparing a meal as early as possible to promote independence and mindful eating.",
        "To commence with, it is observed that many children have a strong interest in food and do not depend on their parents for everything. Firstly, food is one of the essentials that everyone needs in order to survive, it is a great idea that at a young age to develop a wide knowledge about food varieties. Hence they will be aware of foodstuff about what they eat and may avoid unhealthy meal when they are outside their houses.  In addition, teaching children to cook will adapt not only the skills of cooking but being independent.  When their parent is at work, for instance, they will be able to make up their own healthy meals.",
        "On the contrary,  there are few people who believe that children should only focus on their studies and cooking can be quite detrimental. There are parents are strictly following their offsprings academic records and performances at school. Although, attaining a high grades in school is important, it is also significant to achieve skills that are away from school and be known in the house. Consequently, having the abilities to prepare a healthy food matter, especially when they reach the adult age. Above all, parents should supervise their children strictly especially when using the knives, fire and other dangerous equipment that can be found in the kitchen premises.",
        "To conclude, it\u2019s clear that while the importance of study and the dangers of cooking shouldn\u2019t be overlooked, they can both be managed and children should be able to develop their own independence and cooking skills."
