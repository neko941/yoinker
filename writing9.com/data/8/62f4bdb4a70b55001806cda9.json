        "Nowadays, folks can just click their fingers to access numerous information  online regarding the culture and history of certain places. Hence a section of society holds a belief that museums are not a prerequisite in this millennial era. This essay will highlight why museum sources are superior  compared to online information, along with my perspective regarding this issue.",
        "On the one hand, the online information that people received  is not fully true, and some of them might be fabricated from the original one, unlike the original source at the museum. As a result, the fake information that has been spread on any media mass platform will gaslight people's mindset about the truth. Recent news by \"BBC\", has found that at least 32% of the fake sources are spread on social media annually in the United States. It is no doubt that today's people have an intuitive understanding of how to misuse this kind of ever-changing technology.",
        "On the other hand, the museum itself holds a sentimental source  in which unavailable  online sources. Therefore, society needs to evade it from being obsolete as it has a plethora of historical artefacts that are stored there. For instance, Malaysia National Museums have more than 500 old artefacts that have been accumulated since the 1900s. However, it is undeniable that online information can be utilitarian for people, for example, there is no limit or geographical boundary for folks to find their desired historical sources. Despite this, it just poses a minor threat to the physical information which folks can seize at the museum.",
        "In conclusion, although online sources might  come in handy in contrast to physical sources, the truth is still vague. I completely agree that museums are still necessary for folks to broaden their horizons about historical information."
