        "With my two cents, I would like to recommend the \"photography\"course, I have done this subject since my first year at Wollongong University. There are a lot of solid reasons to account for why I think suitable for you.  First of all, this subject includes three assignments, 2000 words essay, a presentation and final photo work. As I know, you don't like any exams. Therefore, I think that would be good for you.",
        "What is more, Dr Derek is a great person in the photography field. He is humble, friendly, and professional. Don't forget to advance two weeks online to enrol his course time. I promise you would have a wonderful study experience with this subject.",
        "Looking for hearing your reply, we may have a cup of coffee  next semester.",
