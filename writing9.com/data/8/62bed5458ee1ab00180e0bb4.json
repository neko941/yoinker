        "Although it was working very good during last week yet from Monday onwards, it starts troubling me. I was working on a presentation related to my official duty which was to be submitted within a week. However,It buffers a lot and its speed was also reduced to 2mbps due to which I was unable to use the internet for my work. I could not accomplish my  task due to a slow connection and called for an explanation from my boss as well as a penalty.",
        "Though I contacted customer care and explain my concern yet the problem is not resolved. Therefore, It would be really recommendable if you could please look into the matter. Also, I want you to please make arrangements  for a technician who can visit my home and check the modem so that I can use this facility.",
        "As this problem is not my fault, thus, I want to request a reduction in my bill because of these circumstances which create hurdles for me.",
        "I hope you will take corrective action on it and a quick response from your side is needed on this matter.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
