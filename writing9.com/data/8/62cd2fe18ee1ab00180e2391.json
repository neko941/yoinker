In addition to what I have just said, you can enjoy visiting different places. You don\u2019t need to wait for a long holiday to travel. Moreover, you will learn new things and find friends around the world. Furthermore, It is plain to see, during rush hours which are 8 Am and 4 Pm that employees are coming home from work leads to traffic. This is a contributing factor to air and sound pollution. If people go to different places to inhabit , for example, some are interested in living in suburbs on the grounds of fresh air and beautiful scenery, there won\u2019t be any traffic and pollution",
