        "It is becoming a trend around the world, people visit the most hostile places around the world as they demand so much  excitement in their lives. In this essay, I am going to discuss  the advantages and disadvantages of such visits.",
        "To begin with, let us discuss the positives. One of the main advantages is, that these people can get proud of themselves by achieving their goals under the toughest conditions on earth. For example, let's assume a scenario where a group  intend to reach the top of the Himalayas. We all know how it would be difficult, because of weather conditions, sometimes may be  difficult to breathe. What if they reach their goal, it is hard to imagine how an individual would celebrate such an occasion. Only a few  on earth can do such things. In addition, these tours can improve an individual's mental toughness. Referring to the same example, to reach  a certain mile-stone a man should have a kind of mental ability to motivate their own self. So, as much as you get familiar with these kinds of situations, the mind of a man will practice bearing such situations. That is good practice to have when you are in  normal life.",
        "Even though  there are some positives, there are some disadvantages as well. For instance, these kinds of explorations may affect badly  a person's health. A few days back, I read a news article about a guy who went on climbing mountains as a hobby. As a result of doing these regularly, now he can hardly walk and also he has some difficulty  breathing as well. Moreover, these visits can result in death. We can see a lot of stories of such tragic incidents  if we search on the internet.",
        "To encapsulate my writing, there will be no harm in visiting those places with  proper guidance and as well a practice before going to do  such a tour. Because  they really help you to develop your character though there are rare incidents of getting killed on the way."
