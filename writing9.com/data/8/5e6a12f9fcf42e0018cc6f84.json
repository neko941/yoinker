        "I am writing this letter with regards to the award being offered by your newspaper. I believe, Jon Cene the head social worker for our area should get this award. He is a very hard working and prominent member of our society.",
        "Jon is an engineer by profession, however, on weekends he runs several initiatives to enhance our community. For instance, his latest program to clean roads was very successful. He also mentors young children to take part in these programs. Even my son is one of the volunteers in his group and speaks highly about him.",
        "In my opinion, we should publish a weekly newspaper article about him that highlights all his achievements. This will not only honour him, but will also motivate young individuals to take part in these activities for the betterment of our community.",
