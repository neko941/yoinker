I am writing this letter to express my sincere gratitude as you helped  my parents every day with their daily needs and shopping during my absence. My parents also were very happy with the kind of help and support you provided in the last  week.",

        "Despite your busy work schedule, you helped  my family all the way. I know, saying just thank you is easy and not at all satisfying to me and my family. Hence, I would like to invite you to my home to have a great lunch next week. Please feel free to let us know your availability and do not hesitate to call me on my mobile number.",
