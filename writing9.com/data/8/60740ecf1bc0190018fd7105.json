        "To be sincere, it wasn't planned, I went to the show with my mum .I later got to know that the community celebrated this event every month of April of the year.  It is a way of coming together for the local people of the community, they dance around the areas with the masquerade and their newly harvested crops.  It is something that is interesting to watch.",
        "I'm very sure you would like to see this event because it says something about the local community and how they celebrate their gods ,which I know is part of the courses you're doing in school.",
        "I'll be very glad if you can spare part of your time with me next week for us both to see the final stage of the event. This would gives opportunity to catch up and spend time with each other and also a way of learning for you  .",
        "Take good care of yourself and I hope to see you soon",
