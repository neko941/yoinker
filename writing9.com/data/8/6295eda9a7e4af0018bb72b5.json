        "With advances in technology, computers have become more valuable than ever before. All kinds of information can be found with the click of a button. This has led individuals to propose that libraries should no longer be funded and investments should go towards new technologies. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and will argue that both these issues should be given equal attention.",
        "To begin with, libraries play an important role in society. They are not only places where people go to read but are also hubs where like-minded individuals can meet and exchange ideas. If they did not exist it would be hard to find places where people can meet and study. Moreover, they are an important part of a society's heritage and serve as a place where information is stored in real life. Contrary to machinery which relies on electricity and servers that can be hacked and taken down. This allows information to be stored safely in a known place.",
        "On the other hand, Computers are becoming more valuable. New articles and research publications come out daily and the ability to upload them online allows for instant viewing of the latest news. This,way they are becoming more important. Furthermore, they eliminate the need for paper and printing. This allows for a more environmentally friendly solution and saves on the need to cut down trees to produce paper.",
        "In my opinion, both the funding of technology and libraries are equally important. One cannot be prioritized over the other.  One serves as an integral part of a community and the other provides a look to the future."
