        "The increasing level of violence in the media is a pressing question for modern society. Parents are concerned about its effect on kids' susceptible mental state. However, what side effects of watching violent behaviour are? In my view, there are two main consequences of being a witness of abuse either on screen or in video games.",
        "Young brain is in developing stage, which means that it is exposed to any information from the environment. To put it another way children cannot separate the good behaviour from the bad one because they only learn the world. By watching movies with scenes of abuse, children begin to accept violence as a way of problem solving and they try to imitate the behaviour of the game. Moreover, children who are shown abusive things either on screen or in real life, they have higher level if anxiety and stress. It happens because of the picture of unstable, dangerous and unsafe world which they get either from movies or video games. That  is why high levels of violence may cause negative effects for a child's development.",
        "In my view, there are three main solutions to deal with this problem. First of all, parents must put censorship on TV programmes, movies and video games which contain violent scenes. This may be done by turning on special settings. Another way of reducing the exposure to abusive entertainment is to inure children in various hobbies. For example, painting picture, learning languages or doing sports is far more useful for children than watching TV all day long. The last and the most important advice is the next one. Parents must spend more time with their children so that they diminish the impact of digital entertainment and they create strong bonds with their offsprings. Consequently if parents take these advices into account then they should not worry about violence in screens.",
        "In conclusion, I pose that increasing level of violence is a major problem though it may be easily tackled. Filtering the content of entertainment, inuring kids to amusing hobbies and spending more time with parents are the best ways of minimizing side effects from the digital entertainment."
