You are free to call me anytime, in case my number is not reachable you can try the other numbers mentioned below it. I\u2019ve kept my dog\u2019s food in the top right corner drawer of the kitchen. You need to feed him twice a day in his favorite bowl kept next to his food. Also, you need to water the plants once in the morning & keep the daily newspapers inside on my study desk.",
