        "I\u2019m now living in a fully furnished brand new house. It has a large living room, a modular kitchen, two cosy bedrooms and especially a spacious parking area. The house is surrounded by a beautiful garden, which I love the most. The balcony is very attractive and it is the place where I relax after a long busy day. The rent is quite high; nevertheless, I am comfortable living here because of the easy access to office and other amenities.",
        "So, when are we going to meet up? If you have time next weekend please come with your family. We will have lunch and spend some quality time together. You can also take a look at my new house.",
