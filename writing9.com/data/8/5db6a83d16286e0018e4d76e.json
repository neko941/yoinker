For instance, in the fall, in our province, Yasouj, compromising between warm and cool taste should be taken into account through eating kitchen soup so that our body can endure against freezing temperature. Hence, equilibrium and parity among our diet can prevent to the outbreak of ailments such as diabetes, heart disease, or other life-threatening illnesses.",
