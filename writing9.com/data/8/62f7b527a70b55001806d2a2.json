        "Dear Mr Black and Mr Hawkins,",
        "I am writing this letter to inform you that I have to discontinue your evening class \"Introduction to Business Analysis\". I enjoyed the lectures from you about all the background theories of business analysis, tools and techniques of data analysis and visualization. Unfortunately, in an unfavourable situation, I will not be able to join your classes anymore.",
        "Early this month, the new management team of my company introduced a shift system to all the employees. They have been thinking of deploying this system since the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although it will not extend the business hours of each employee, we are going to have randomized working hours every weekday. So, I will no longer be able to confirm that I will be available during class times.",
        "Although I am no longer able to continue the class at the moment, I do not want you to refund my tuition fees. Instead, I would like to join a similar class on weekends in the upcoming batch. Despite I have learnt 15% of your lectures, I am more than happy to start over from the beginning.",
        "Lastly, I am sorry for all these unnecessary arrangements, I hope you will give my request some consideration and I am sure I will learn at my best if I get a chance to shift to the upcoming weekend class.",
        "Sincerely,",
        "Zay Yar Myint."
