Since we have not had the opportunity to meet each other since last year hence, I\u2019m writing to update you about what happened to me  the last spring. It feels like I\u2019m on cloud nine. I have moved to my dream apartment in  downtown Toronto. Do you remember how much I was obsessed to live in heart of this metropolitan since I immigrated to Canada in 2018?",
        "Last November I  got a promotion and I\u2019m holding the chief accounting manager position in our company. Fortunately, my salary increased which made me capable of affording the high accommodation rent of this neighbourhood. There is a balcony with a view of the city which the sparkling image of the town at night, blows my mind. I am really passionate to show the place and catch up on what happened to us during this year. Since there is a national holiday  next week, this would be amazing to have you here! We will defiantly have fun.",
