        "Without any doubt,society is divided into two groups as per the distinct mindset of different people.This essay will not only shed light on both perceptions but also my point of view will be elaborated in the conclusion.",
        "To commence with,the first and foremost notion there are myriad things to be shared in its favour.Few  guardians thought that seeing TV and playing electronic games is an advantage in the growth of the  pupils.For instance, if learners play with electronic distractions this would help  them to gain knowledge about the new technology and  playing different kinds of entertainment also sharpens their brains.This also helps them to reduce the stress , that they gain from their studies during exam days.As a result, playing pastime on an electronic product is not harmful and it is easy to use .Apart from this, it gave them joy and relaxation from the hustle and bustle of  life.",
        "Moving towards the second argument of this debate, the first point of this few believes that it has a harmful impact on youth . It is one of the main obstacles to the development of the mind.To cite an example,by playing online games they become overweight due to which many diseases are generated.And it also gives rise to many chronic diseases like cancer.In addition, it also has dangerous effects on their eyes as well.Many of them are becoming blind and suffer from many other diseases.To illustrate, even every juvenile is using spectacles for watching the world.As consequence,it is a serious problem and parents should take of their children.",
        "In nutshell,according to my ,perspective this topic has more demerits as compared to its merits.Although all  people are having different views about this topic some thought it is good for  children as they gain knowledge related to different new products that are now possible in the market yet few believe it impacts the eyes of the pupils and elevated the weight of the learner by sitting at one place."
