        "It is commonly thought by some people that secondary or high school students should be given the knowledge of managing finances as it will be able to shape the course of their future. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this viewpoint as it is a skill that will be beneficial for them in numerous occasions in their life.",
        "First of all, one of the striking benefits of learning money management is that it will be able to provide a stable foundation for their life well before they step into the adulthood. For instance, if they manage the money given by their parents without wasting them inappropriately, they will be able to use the money to invest in banks or businesses which more often will stabilize their future. Moreover, this skill is crucial when they become adults. Nowadays, more and more individuals can be perceived whose life have become miserable and unfortunate owing to lack of money management.",
