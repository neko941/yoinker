        "In which way children are the most influenced is a topic of controversy. There is an opinion saying that family has a great impact on the development of kids, while others believe children are more influenced by the outside environment. From my perspective, I approve of the former idea and the justifications are as follows.",
        "On the one hand, some individuals have the right to argue that the effects from outside the home contribute significantly to kids' development. Firstly, getting access to public websites or social networking sites such as Facebook or Zalo is one of the factors that affect a child vary. There are various videos, songs, pictures, and short films shown on these net platforms that children may watch and imitate the characters. Secondly, friends also have a considerable effect on the growth of children. Since at school, kids who share the same personalities and interests may form a group, being a part of that community will make children's thoughts and behaviors affected.",
        "On the other hand, I think that youngsters are mostly affected by their families. Family is the place where children are born and brought up, so parents are the ones who accompany their offspring during their early childhood. As a result, every action and emotional expression of fathers and mothers is witnessed and learned by their children, which will greatly contribute to the formation of their characteristics and behaviors. For instance, if a child grows up in a close-knit family, his parents will set a good example for him to become a person who knows how to love other people. Besides, parents play a vital role in orienting children's lives as they give essential advice to children and help them to make the right decisions.",
        "In conclusion, although factors namely friends or the Internet do have a significant impact on children, I believe the family has the greatest influence on the development of children."
