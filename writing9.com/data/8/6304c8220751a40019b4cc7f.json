        "Dear Mr Smith",
        "I hope you are well and still in good condition. It's been 6 months since we talked to each other and I really missed the days in which you gave me pieces of advice on my studies and on my future career as well. Your guidance helped me during my schooling and for that I am grateful.",
        "Recently, there's news that a well-known restaurant is going to branch out in this area and they are going to look for an applicant two weeks from now. I am planning to put in an application for the chef position as it could help me improve my skills in cooking. Being a graduate student in culinary arts, it is a pleasure to be able to work in a prestige company as it could provide more training experience to a fresh graduate like me. One of their strict requirement is for an applicant to have a reference letter attached to their resume. Without it, my application letter will be denied immediately. If you would be so kind as you can make me a reference letter that contains my character, my achievements in school and my willingness and dedication to my career.",
        "I will wait for your reply at the soonest. I hope you can help me with this matter.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
