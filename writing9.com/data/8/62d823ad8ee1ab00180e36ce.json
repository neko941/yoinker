        "While some individuals argue that authorities should invest more in ancient artworks such as printings and figures to enhance their living standards, others beg to differ. This essay agrees with this statement as the government should not dismiss other aspects of their country. In this essay, I shall discuss the benefits of tourism in the country and I will go further to discuss the improvements and motivations of the artist.",
        "To begin with, it has been obvious that work of art such as building a monument is an extremely helpful idea in terms of tourist attractions. Moreover, the reason behind this is that many tourists will have the motivation to visit a certain country to see its sightseeing, and thus, more revenues will be added to a country's budget. For example, the vast majority of people who visit New York City for tourism will not leave the state without having seen the sculptures. This figure added more and more benefits to the city. Having said that, if the government does not spend more on these sculptures, people will not be able to recognize a city.",
        "Furthermore, by spending more money on this kind of art, any artist will be encouraged to work harder and harder to grow a country's culture. Therefore, this will also assist them in improving their income. For instance, Italy is well known for its artists. However, the Italian government motivates the artists by allowing them to showcase their paintings on every road and most crowded area without being taxed or fined. Italy is now one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Nevertheless, the government should also be generous with infrastructure. Roads, bridges, and even buildings should also be maintained to maintain their beauty.",
        "In summary, although spending more money on art is indeed beneficial in terms of revenue and improving one's life but the government should not neglect the maintenance of other aspects."
