        "The Internet has crept into our lives long before and become an indisputable part of it .Yet,many believe this development has changed our lives in a bad way.However,I personally believe the benefits of the internet far outweigh the drawbacks.These benefits are twofold.",
        "First of all,the WWW has altered the way we communicate with each other.At the moment,we all have the chance to keep in touch with our loved ones even if they live far away.Also,there are many apps that provide you with voice and video chats in high quality,including Telegram,Facebook and Instagram.It is true that  there is a risk of social isolation,as many of us spend too much time on the internet searching the web.Despite this drawback,I still think we gain more than we lose from the enhanced cyberspace connection.Being able to communicate  with the ones in other countries gives you an opportunity to connect with them whenever you miss or feel like talking.",
        "Equally importantly,though,the Internet has placed the entire world in our hands.In the past,doing research or other academic papers demanded an excessive amount of time.Now,however,we can get all materials we need with  just a click of a button.Admittedly,not all the data available on the internet is reliable.The online world  gives us access to all kinds of information from pornography to instructions to make bombs,for example.But it is for us to make the right choice while finding the proper knowledge.",
        "By way of conclusion,I once again reaffirm my position that the Internet has far more positive impacts on our modern life in regards to communication and the flow of information."
