In addition, the way you supplied our daily shopping needs was really a priceless service. On top of that, during daytime support, you helped my father with gardening work as well and I can feel the amount of time you spent at my gardening cleaning along with the making the fence .",

Hence, I would like to invite you to my home to have a great lunch next week. Please feel free to let us know your availability and do not hesitate to call me on my mobile number.",
