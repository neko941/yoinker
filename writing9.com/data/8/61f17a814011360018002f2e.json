        "In some peoples opinion,as all learning material is available online and students can learn from the comfort of home ,they do not require to attend the school in person,while others believe it is vital to go to school for all directional growth of students.The next paragraphs will shed light on both sides of the notion but, I think attending school in person is more beneficial than online.",
        "At present due to the covid-19 pandemic for reducing the spread of infection, the majority of universities and higher study institutes started online learning and it works better for them.So some people argue that this should be fine for schools too.Because  learning material is available on the internet and video learning through google classrooms should work the same way for children.Furthermore ,it will save their time to travel back and forth from home to school.Additionally,they do not need to face harsh temperatures in some countries like Canada where  in winter temperature remains below zero.",
        "On the other hand, students in early learning classes do not have the computer knowledge to go online and attend classes,their attention span is limited so,they need constant reminders which,is not possible in online classes.Although  they can study learning material online,  life lessons like discipline,teamwork,respect and other moral values can not be taught through online classes.Additionally,connectivity of the internet is an issue that disrupts learning activities.Furthermore, peer relations which are an important life lesson will be missed. Long hours on screen can damage the eyesight of students.",
        "In ,conclusion online learning   looks more convenient but, is not that beneficial for schools in terms of all directional development of students. so I will refer to person schooling for students in early grades."
