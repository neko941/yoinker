        "I currently hold a full-time position as a Software Engineer at Microsoft. I have been recently promoted to a more senior position at work with increased responsibilities and workload. As a result, I have been having a hard time balancing time between the full-time job and my classwork. Moreover, my personal life is also getting affected as I have little to no time that I can spend with my family.",
        "Give my current lack of time and heavy workload, I have decided to drop out of the course and focus on my career and family for the time being. I had a great practical experience attending your class and I look forward to attending the class again in the future and complete it whenever I find a suitable time for it.",
        "I want to thank you for all the support and guidance that you have provided me so far through the course which has been of great help both academically and professionally.",
