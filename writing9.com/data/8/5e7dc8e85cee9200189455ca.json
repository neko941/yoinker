        "People\u2019s opinions differ as to whether or not school children should be given the task. While there are some strong arguments against the setting of homework, I still believe that it is a necessary aspect of education.",
        "There are several reasons why people might argue that homework is an unnecessary burden on children. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that homework does nothing to improve educational outcomes. Countries such as Finland, where school children are not given exercise, regularly top international education league tables and outperform nations where setting teaching is the norm. Secondly, many parents would agree that the institution day is already long enough, and leaves their children too tired to do further study when they return home. Finally, it is recognised that play time is just as beneficial as study time from the perspective of brain development.",
        "In spite of the above arguments, I support the view that lecture has an important role to play in the schooling of children. The main benefit of task is that it encourages independent learning and problem solving, as children are challenged to work through tasks alone and at their own pace. In doing so, students must apply the knowledge that they have learnt in the classroom. For example, by doing mathematics exercises at home, students consolidate their understanding of the concepts taught by their teacher at university. In my view, it is important for children to develop an independent study habit because this prepares them to work alone as adults.",
        "In conclusion, the practice certainly has its drawbacks, but I believe that the benefits outweigh them in the long term."
