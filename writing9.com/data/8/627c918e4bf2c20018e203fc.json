Some people belive that eventually all the work will be done by robots while others belive that there will be a limit to the tasks that robots can perform.\nChoose which position you most agree with and discuss why you choose that position. Support your point of view with details from your own experiences observations or reading. Write between 200 and 300 words.",

        "With the increase in artificially intelligent ,robots the number of human jobs has  declined significantly. It is often argued that robots will conduct all the work eventually, while some people object to this because there will be certain particular tasks which cannot be performed by robots. This essay will discuss why human jobs will be taken over by robots, indeed.",
        "In the coming days, Robots with artificial intelligence will overtake humans and perform all work which humans are performing now. The consistency and reliability of machines in comparison to humans in  just unmatchable. For example, the resilience of robots to do work persistently is much  higher than that of human beings. Moreover, there are numerous jobs which are unreachable to humans and can easily be conducted by robots. For instance, going out of the world and researching  the universe. As a result of this undeniable capacity, there is no reason why human jobs won't  be replaced by computers in the coming days.",
        "However, some people are rejecting the fact that of human replacement and they still believe that there are numerous tasks which cannot be operated only by programming machines. Without acknowledging the growth of technology these people do the advocacy objecting to machine power. Nowadays, even the crucial sectors of human existence like health and education are also been mechanised.",
        "In conclusion, human forces are drastically overtaken by Artificial intelligence. Though there are some countable jobs which only humans can do, In my opinion, there is only a limited time before robots will completely replace human jobs in spite of human intelligence."
