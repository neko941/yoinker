        "I read in last week\u2019s edition of the White Horse News that you are keen to reward local people who have made significant contributions to the community . I would like to put my mother , Mrs . Gillian Summerton , forward for this reward .",
        "My mother is a schoolteacher , and has done much to enrich the lives of the young people in her care . In her free time , she continues to give up her time to help people . She runs a ladies\u2019 choir which is a superb opportunity for local women to get together and enjoy themselves . Moreover , the choir performs free of charge at charity events , and consequently my mother has been fundamental in both raising large sums of money and bringing pleasure to people .",
        "I know that my mother does not need a financial reward for her services to the community , as it gives her a lot of pleasure . However , I\u2019m sure that she would appreciate formal recognition for her work , perhaps in the form of a donation to her preferred charity , the Red Cross .",
        "Thank you for your attention.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
