        "I am writing to request  two weeks'  leave to complete my final thesis which I should submit  by next month.",
        "As you know, I have been following a master's in business analytics at Informatics Sri Lanka for almost two years. Past three months, I have been working on the final project which is about implementing sales forecasting models for paint and furnishing products using artificial intelligence and machine learning. Moreover, these modules were not covered in  part of the program. As a result ,  I was doing a lot of research online and going through various Youtube videos. Also, I have gathered about 25 to 30 research papers which could help me to complete the projects. Further, I have completed my experiments with these models and the models are working as intended. However, I  have not completed writing the thesis which covers around 18,000 words.",
        "Therefore, I would like you to approve my annual leave in order for me to complete the project. In addition, I have allocated James to follow up on new requests from clients and resolve them as soon as possible to make sure there will not be any delay from our side due to limited resources.",
        "I look forward to receiving your response soon.",
