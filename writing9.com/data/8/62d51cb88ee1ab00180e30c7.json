        "I`m writing to draw your attention to the recent bad experience I ended up facing while I was trying to admit my daughter to Hemas hospital.",
        "Last week my daughter was suffering from a severe stomach ache, therefore I decided to take her to the emergency department. Firstly, before even asking what exactly was wrong with my daughter, they asked to me make some payments which sound really unprofessional. Secondly, they asked us to sit while they were preparing a bed. Although my daughter was in an agony of pain, they constantly ignored us, moreover, they took almost two hours to arrange the bed for her to lie down. Finally, it took another two hours for the doctor to turn up.",
        "It was a very unpleasant experience and I am quite shocked how the hospital staff could behave in such an unprofessional manner. I demand you to look into this matter very seriously, hence this behaviour could lead the patients` situation much worse. In addition, I need a prompt reply with what action you decided to take and what changes you made in order to improve service quality. Failure to do so, I am happy to lodge a complaint to the department of health.",
