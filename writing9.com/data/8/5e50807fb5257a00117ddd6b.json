        "Dear Sir,",
        "My name is Anish Srivastava and I am a resident at 555 Sherbourne. I am writing to inform you that the local council has expressed their interest in selling the park nearby my home. This is a very bad news for most of the residents who live nearby as it will have many negative consequences.",
        "Let me explain you the situation in more detail. There are around 3000 people in my locality and all of them are dependent on this park heavily. Approximately, 400 to 500 people come to this park daily for jogging and walking. Furthermore, this is the only place where seniors get together and spend time with each other. If the park is sold, then these people have to go to the other nearest park which is 3 miles away from our locality. The distance will make it quite tough for seniors to commute on a daily basis.",
        "If the council goes ahead with this plan, I would have no option but to raise this matter to higher authorities. I would be grateful to you if you can look at this matter and do the needful.",
        "Regards,",
        "Anish S."
