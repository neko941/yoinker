        "Let me introduce myself first. My name is James Thomson and I recently joined your concert which was held  last Friday at National Museum.",
        "Firstly , I really empress your vocal tone on that day . In addition , I also appreciate your dress style and performance as well . Although  the place is small and uncomfortable , it is worth enough to listen to all your music. However , I would like to recommend you to arrange in a large area instead of the small hall in the future .",
        "To be honest ,  I enjoy participating in some musical events and concerts which are held by local communities. Moreover , my parents are also encouraged  me to join the National Songs competition and I also decided to take this opportunity.",
        "However , I need your support to fulfil my goal because I need to learn loads of techniques from you like dressing,performing and singing confidently.",
        "I hope you could help me and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .",
        "Best regards ,",
