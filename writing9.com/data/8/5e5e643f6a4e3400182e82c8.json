        "Throughout the world, one of the parents\u2019 concerns is that their children are being raised creatively and to achieve the creativity instead of reading they use visual and intellectual games. These delightful actions have many beneficial achievements and contributes to the children will be more skills. I am a strong advocate of this approach, and I try to point out some of these benefits.",
        "On the one hand, according to official statistics myriad of children do not take pleasure from reading and continuing the trend will be considered a compulsion for them and the children will probably resist it. Learning through reading will be raised kids mono dimensional and creates lots of problems. For example, imagine a seller specializing in his field can\u2019t be successful, on the ground that he has not learned social skills as well.",
        "On the other hand, the best thing that parents can do for their offspring is to flourish their kids\u2019 talents. The best way to fulfil this important is teaching kids through enjoyable activities. By this method fathers and mothers can discover their child\u2019s genius and grow it. This attitude brings about the kids learn many skills at an early age simultaneously. For instance, my three-year old daughter has learned many skills by this technique and notwithstanding her young age, furthermore her native language, she has learned many concepts such as numbers, characters, shapes, and colours in English.",
        "In conclusion, as I mentioned above, teaching by interest is more sufficient then reading for kids. I highly recommended as a father, don\u2019t restrict your babies just by reading."
