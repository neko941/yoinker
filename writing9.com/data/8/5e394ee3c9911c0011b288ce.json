        "Dear Mr Ali,",
        "I sat next to you on a flight from Brisbane to London on September 18th. You offered me your business card after hearing my enthusiasm to work in a restaurant. I am writing to remind you about a possible job that you offered me during our meeting on this very flight.",
        "It was very kind of you to advise me that I should contact you if I ever want to work in a restaurant. As I mentioned briefly during our delightful conversation, I used to work at a restaurant as an assistant manager and took a break from work to complete my Master's degree. Now that I am willing to work again, I would like you to consider me as a potential employee in one of your restaurants in Australia - perhaps as an assistant manager.",
        "I have worked as an assistant manager in a reputed restaurant in Melbourne for about 3 years and before that, I was in charge of the customer care department in a retail shop. I have completed a course in hotel management from one of the top management schools in Australia. Moreover, I have good exposure in Front Desk Management. I am positive my skills and expertise will definitely be an asset to your organisation.",
        "If you have further queries or need any information, please contact me at the email address or phone number provided on my Curriculum Vitae.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
