        "Dear Alice,",
        "I hope you are doing well! I am a massive fan of yours. Lately, I have seen you at the musical concert in Auckland. You were terrific as usual. I have heard your many songs on Television. It was the first time to watch your show live. It was a great experience. Your performance was outstanding, and the chosen pieces are my favourite by chance. One of my friends accompanied me, and she listened to you for the first time and was completely mesmerized by your melodious voice. She also became your fan and listened to your songs all day.",
        "I am also learning music from a famous tutor in my area. According to him, I am good, but I know I need to improve a lot. I cannot sing emotional songs. So, I have a small request if you can help in enhancing these minor problems. It will help me in achieving greater heights in my career.",
        "I know you are always busy with your concerts and other activities. If you have some time, you can give me a zoom session once a week and can let guide me on my shortcomings.",
        "I'll be looking forward to your positive response.",
        "Yours faithfully",
