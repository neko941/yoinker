        "Dear Sarah,",
        "Thank you so much for your latest letter. I'm really excited to hear that you're planning to apply for the Business English course which I did last semester.",
        "In this course, you will learn how to use English for the profession which is more difficult than what we usually use. When I studied, I had two classes per week and each class was one hour but I have heard from our professor that this year they plan to do three classes per week so you should ask  before applying.",
        "You might study with professor John who has excellent teaching skills. He is a very kind and easy-going person. I would say that this course is very helpful since you will graduate this year and are going to enter working life.",
        "There is an easy way to apply for this course by going to the consultant room and asking them for more detail about it and you can definitely apply through them or in the other way, you can also apply directly to professor John.",
