Yesterday, I have suddenly received a call from my grandfather, and he told me that granny slipped from the staircase. What's more, she got hospitalized as her arm was severely injured,So, I had to go there in the evening. Although my grandfather is there with my grandmother, he cannot handle all these things alone.",
