        "In many places, people are placing much importance on the ownership of a real property, and exerting themselves to achieve that goal rather than living in a rented home. This may come from their insecurity in terms of accommodation and financial concerns. From my point of view, this is a deleterious trend.",
        "First of all, one of the most obvious explanations for this tendency is the sense of security. Staying in a rented home puts the tenant in a dilemma. If the landlord unilaterally terminates the rental contract ahead of schedule, the tenant may find themselves in the situation of having nowhere to live for a while. Therefore, owning a place provides a stable and safe environment for their family members. Secondly, many people opt for owning a home because it releases them from the enormous pressure of the monthly rental fee. For example, for some people, living in a big city, where everything is at exorbitant price, is difficult enough, thus, extra expense for housing is definitely unwanted.",
        "From my perspective, the fact that more and more people are working around the clock to afford a house is more of a negative trend. As the amount of money needed for the transaction is significant, not to mention the increasing taxes added, many people, especially younger citizens have to work extra hours and tight their budgets in order save money for the house. In some other cases, young people opt for a mortgage and tie themselves in a huge debt, resulting in a long period of working overtime, and fail to enjoy their time with families and friends. Owning a house is synonymous to confine oneself in just one neighbourhood, while renting allows people to get to experience more places, and have more opportunities for lucrative job offers.",
        "In conclusion, people\u2019s desire of possessing a property derives from their security concerns and the burden of rental; however, this trend may lead to may adverse circumstances for people, especially the younger ones."
