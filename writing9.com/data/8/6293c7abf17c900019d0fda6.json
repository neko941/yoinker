        "Nowadays everyone has the dream of achieving better than anyone.In the modern era majority of people live in a mind of  competition in the field of job or anything else. Someone believes that today's teenagers are well educated because of this running race or for getting a better chance in their carrier. I agreed with  both notions,this essay will discuss the reasons for these views  in the coming fourth paragraph.",
        "Most   adolescents nowadays are more conscious of their professional education than in the past days.They all thinking about their better future at the time of school level. In past ,the rate of literate people are less, most of them diverted to something other jobs after their higher secondary education.But in this modern world, students are more practical and concise about their dream life.Because of that, youngsters must earn a high level of  professional certification. For example, Today most   companies first prefer the candidate for their  level of education after that they checked the  percentage of their knowledge. Thus,in the employment ,field it has more importance.",
        "Opportunities are getting through the level of education. In every field of ,work the type of positions is desired in the terms of  graduation, such as promotions  or going to other  countries for  field trips and so on. It depends on which what they achieved in their educational period. For instance, My friend's son got a managerial position at the time of joining .He  didn't have any hands  experience but his level of education gets that opportunity.At the same ,time others can't get it because of a low level of achievement.",
        "To Conclude, people argued   both notions  are  correct points of view.I believe that, better qualifications can have equal importance in the field of the work environment.Moreover, they can achieve better opportunities and chances to touch their dreams."
