        "Amritsar is a tourist and there are many people like me who make their living because of tourism. As such, the wrong details in an international travel journal can easily hurt the local economy.",
        "Therefore, I am including a detailed time schedule for public transportation as well as their website portal. I hope that your company can verify the details and print a correction along with correcting information on your website.",
