        "Dear Mrs Barrett,",
        "I checked your advertisement in which you mentioned that you were looking for someone to help you in your home. I am writing to you to express my interest to take up this job. For the upcoming summer, I can help you with your daily chores like cooking, cleaning and dog walking.",
        "I would like this job because, in the summers, most   college students enjoy their semester break, so it is very difficult to find a part-time job elsewhere. Moreover, I have already worked as an assistant chef for a restaurant and know how to cook hygienic food. Additionally, I always wanted a dog for myself, so taking care of yours is something that I am really excited about.",
        "As you already know that I will be on my semester break, and I will be available for two months in town. I would be working for you from 8 AM to 12 PM and would not be available in the evenings as I would also be doing a course on programming in addition to this job.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
