        "I am writing to inform you regarding a major concern which I am facing daily due to your cute pet. As you know that your pet is jumping the rail daily and playing around my garden and also it is eating all fruits along with leaves as well, due to this our kids are missing more fun and not at all playing in the garden area.",
        "Firstly, As you know, the fence we have is so aged and under maintenance, hence it is very much easy to jump by even small pets as well, which is leading to a major issue in our community. Therefore, I strongly decided to build a brand new 6 feet  fence  which will prevent all of these recurring issues. I am sure that this will help us to have good relations without any further issues.",
        "As you agreed, we are going to start building of new fence work in mid of next week. Thank you for the acceptance and I would like to ask you a favour to pay half of the cost from your end as well, which would be below 100K as per my knowledge.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you with an update on sharing of expenses.",
        "Best Regards,",
