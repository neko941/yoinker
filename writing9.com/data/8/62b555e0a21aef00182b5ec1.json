        "Many people hold a view that the government's use of money-making attractions aimed at tourists contributes to the destruction of others, believing it is a way to save traditions. In this essay, I will elaborate on both sides and then state my position.",
        "On the first hand, the reason people state that traditional customs are damaged because of commercialization is that means many people have changed many old-fashioned places to make them more suitable and convenient for many visitors. For example, to make it comfortable for tourists in the process of venturing and visiting some big mountains, they build many suspension cables on the way from the ground to the mountain. Had it not been for misplaying the wild landscapes, it would not have the tradition of historical monuments.",
        "On the second hand, others hold that earning money from cultural tradition is a solution to save that culture. Because the government will have expenditure for keeping many historic monuments. In particular, the tourists pay money for visiting many tourist attractions, and those fees will be spent on keeping and repairing cultural traditions. A good example of it is Cu Chi Tunnels, the visitors spend money for buying tickets to visit inside, and that fee is a tool for the government to repair the tunnels. Besides that, Dong Ho folk painting still exists to this day because of the money from selling their paintings to the tourists who visit Dong Ho village. Without money, people will not have the financial resources to maintain the traditions.",
        "To conclude, some argue that using tradition as a money-making attraction has a part to destroy it. Meanwhile, others believe in preserving cultural traditions. In my opinion, I concur with the latter notion."
