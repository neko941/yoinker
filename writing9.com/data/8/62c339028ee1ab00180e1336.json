        "When she made a bill for me and another person at the same time.I was a little suspicious when  I was paying because I know my  grocery bill is 60$ every week. But then I thought it is more due to inflation in the market,However when I reached home I noticed that she charged me for a pack of rice which did not buy which caused me a substantial inconvenience as I paid extra for an unwanted thing.",
        "I would greatly appreciate it if you could add this extra money to my next bill because I do not want a money refund. I will return a packet of rice by tomorrow through courier. If you need any assistance you can text me on 96333788827.",
