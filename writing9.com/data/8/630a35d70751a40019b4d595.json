        "To put it briefly, after buying the device we unboxed it and read the manual first.Then we followed up the directions.However, the stuff did not work when we plugged and turned it on. Immediately after ,then we called the store while in our two calls there was no answer.Finally, on the third ,call we could reach the sales representative ,John. While explaining the problem to him in detail as he said that jotted down all and would be directing us to the technical service to check this issue latest in three hours. Nevertheless, no one came or called even after the specified timeline. Therefore, I called the store again and again but could not reach anyone.",
        "I am asking politely to provide a solution to my complaint. This experience is not only unpleasant but also a concern to your customer satisfaction policy of your brand which you specified at every stage. My kind demand is to replacing the device with the new one without any additional cost",
        "I am looking to hearing from you as soon as possible",
        "Kind regards"
