        "I am writing this letter in connection with the serious problems that I have faced since I moved to room No.253.",
        "To begin with, I have a roommate who is a student of music and he needs to practice his musical instruments all day. In addition, he often listens to music loudly deep in the night. His activities have negatively affected my concentration on my work. For example, a couple of days ago I had to take an important exam and I needed to have a bit of quiet to review my papers a day before the exam.  However, my roommate started playing his violin without paying attention to my request. It resulted in a serious dispute between us so I decided to move out of the room as soon as possible.",
        "I would like you to take my request into consideration and facilitate my movement to a more cosy and quiet room where I will be able to lead my academic life without any further issues. I prefer not to share the room with anyone else.",
        "I hope you consider my request and reply back to my letter very soon.",
