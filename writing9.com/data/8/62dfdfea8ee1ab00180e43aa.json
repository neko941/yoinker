        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter to express some of my suggestions, which may improve our college cafeteria seating arrangement. I am a student, Utsav, from the A-127 batch, studying Economics. My student ID is 456-RYD.",
        "To begin with, I am fond of the state-of-art facilities offered by the cafeteria, such as smart chairs and tables. In addition to that, I believe, the new wall design is fabulous.",
        "That being said, it came to my notice recently that a lot of students eat while standing in the cafeteria during lunchtime because of improper seating arrangement. As a result of this, many students, including myself, do not enjoy their meals on a regular basis and others eat outside the campus at local restaurants.",
        "In the wake of this problem, I would like you to add ample chairs and tables in the cafeteria that can accommodate students during lunch hours and tea breaks.",
        "I am certain that you would consider my suggestions.",
