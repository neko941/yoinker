        "The importance of environmental sustainability cannot be overemphasized. Some people insist that government should take full responsibility for the task due to the lack of power of individuals. However, I believe that one can attribute to nature even with a tiny step. The following paragraphs will manifest the explanations of my opinion.",
        "Although respective actions could be hard to observe, it does not mean changes did not occur. Despite the fact that authorities are in charge of handling rubbish, however, one can also contribute to the sanitation of our society. For instance, keeping oneself from littering could be as simple as a pie and you may not feel the impact of it. Nevertheless, if everyone starts to adapt to such behaviour, the littering problem will be anticipated to solve in the near future.",
        "Moreover, the problem may be a nationwide problem but it does not mean it is unmanageable to a single person. The hygienic condition is based on every citizen's contribution to our habitat. Many people tend to drive to work or school these days, while the living condition got wealthier. Nonetheless, people forgot the habit of convenience has posed several threats to our surroundings, such as water pollution and deteriorated air quality. If the general public can sacrifice some part of conveniences, for example, riding on public transportation, such as buses, trains, and metros, instead of driving a car or riding a motorcycle, such variant can not only save substantial money on commuting but also can give a lift to saving the planet.",
        "By way of conclusion, it is undoubtedly that mise en sc\u00e8ne demands everyone's effort, and no one is an exception. It is imperative for every human being to find out the balance between living and the precious environment."
