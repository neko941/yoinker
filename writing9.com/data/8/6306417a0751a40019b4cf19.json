        "Firstly, the reference number of the accessory is WAS-222 and also it was a blue cord model which was delivered to my address on 28th August 2022. Secondly, I was surprised the power indicator on it did not come up when I make an attempt to charge my smartphone with it.",
        "However, it was very frustrating because it could not serve the purpose I intend to use it for, as my gadget battery was flaten t all through the weekend since I could not get any alternative.",
        "Subsequently, I want a replacement from your company and the bill of delivery should be free to compensate me for the trauma this action has caused. However, the new accessory to be sent should be working perfectly and the delivery time should be prompt without further delay.",
