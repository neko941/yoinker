        "In our modern society, it is not quite easy to find people doing unpaid work. Certain people believe that teenagers should do volunteer work in their cities because there are advantages for themselves as well as their community. I significantly agree with this statement. This essay will address why I support this view and will include relevant dates for supporting my opinion.",
        "First of all, teenagers are able to learn a job that they want to get in the future through volunteer work. For instance, they have the opportunity to know that there are so many kinds of work in this world, moreover, they can learn what they like and what they are good at through unpaid work, which leads to finding their suit jobs effectively. Famous research conducted by the Japanese government in 2020 illustrated that the person who experienced unpaid work got a 30% higher salary because they could choose suit job for them compared to the person who did not. Thus, this makes it clear that experiencing unpaid work is good for individuals.",
        "Furthermore, NPO organizations can gather a large number of people for their services through volunteer work by teenagers. It has been recognized that only a few people are willing to dedicate to NPO services because the majority of citizens are likely to prefer getting high salary jobs although the NPO service is essential for our society. However, if teenagers do unpaid work, it helps these organizations as long as 20 % of the population is located to teenagers. Therefore, it becomes apparent that unpaid work by teenagers has a good impact on their society as well.",
        "In conclusion, there are advantages for the individuals and their society in terms of experiencing work for choosing their future jobs and gathering a large number of people for NPO organizations. With these advantages, I totally agree with the statement that the younger generation should do volunteer work. After a thorough analysis of this subject, it is predicted that the number of unpaid work by teenagers will be increased in the future."
