        "Dear Mr. Anderson,",
        "Greetings of the day! I am writing this letter to tell you about the issue faced by me because of the noisy behaviour of your dog at night.",
        "The American bully dog that you purchased last Sunday has been creating a lot of noise since the very first night. It started barking from 1 AM to 4 AM daily which is causing me sleeplessness and I got a severe headache due to this. Moreover, as I am a construction supervisor, I require a sound sleep at night to make myself able to work properly with machines. However, your dog\u2019s high intensity barking noise is totally absurd for my health.",
        "Therefore, I want you to shift the dog house to some other area of your house or call an animal doctor for a checkup to find out the reason behind its noisy nature. A legal discourse would be followed against you if you do not try to solve this problem timely. I hope you would consider the genuinity of my situation and act accordingly.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon in this regard.",
        "Regards,",
