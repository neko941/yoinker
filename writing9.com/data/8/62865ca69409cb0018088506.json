        "Music plays a vital role in swinging the mood of people. According to a few, it can bring individuals from different nations and ages closer to each other. I partially agree with the notion as elderly people are more attached to conventional music.",
        "In this contemporary world, various forms of melodies are published on youtube and other online media sources. Individuals can easily find eminent music from social platforms. Particular music has a connection to their culture. For example, Opera music which is more famous in Europe makes us learn about the connected drama. Likewise, a group of people can adapt traditions of other countries by listening to their music.",
        "However, elderly people of the nation like to hear traditional tones more as it is attached to their culture. Many events and festivals are celebrated using local music which makes them more attached to it. Also, old music is more connected to their memories. In India, for instance, the majority of elderly people like old melodical songs which restrict them to come out from their memories and hold themselves to connect to the different parts of the world. Therefore, it is hard for all age  groups to adapt to new music as it might not attract them.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that though people nowadays have started listening music from different countries, there are still some groups of citizens who are connected to their own cultural melodies. Hence, some of them are connected with other cultures whereas others choose to live in their own world."
