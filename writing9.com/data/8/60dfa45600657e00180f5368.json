        "It is thought by some experts in the field of education that exchange students from other countries have a positive impact on teenage students at the school. Looking at this issue from cultural and developmental perspectives, the benefits far exceed the drawbacks.",
        "There are some disadvantages to having international students. One evident drawback is that it could lead to miscommunication between them and students at the school. Both students experience language barriers when interacting with each other, which often causes misunderstanding and confusion. In addition, cultural differences could significantly hinder communication, causing students to develop frustration and fear. As a result, they develop negative attitudes towards other cultures, which contradicts the important purpose of having exchange visits. This point is highlighted in a survey conducted by the Ministry of Education in Japan showing that as much as 20% of high school students in Japan lost confidence to converse with foreigners after having exchange students in their school.",
        "However, international student visits offer significant benefits to teenagers at the school. One obvious advantage is that it promotes cultural understanding. Interaction with peers from other cultures provides a valuable opportunity to learn that every culture is unique and acquire tolerance and acceptance of differences, which is becoming increasingly crucial in this global age. Therefore, even though miscommunication could be expected, teenagers reap the benefit from cross-cultural communication in the long run. Furthermore, speaking to international students face-to-face is a more powerful way to form an emotional connection to their countries than simply reading about them. It is widely reported that individuals who have a friend from another country are more likely to have a positive view of that country compared to those without.  While the risk of a culture clash remains, it can be greatly mitigated through thorough preparation such as classes about the visitors\u2019 country and culture.",
        "In conclusion, although there are some downsides to international exchange programmes, the positives far outweigh the negatives. It is crucial that schools take measures to ensure a safe and effective learning environment for both international and domestic students."
