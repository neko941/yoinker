        "Some experts believe that children should start learning a foreign language at the elementary level than when they are in high school. Although learning a new language can be so difficult for youngsters, my firm conviction is that the merits of this, are more significant than the demerits.",
        "There are two main benefits to learning a new language in a primary academy. Firstly, is the ease of learning. Youngsters have flexible minds and they can learn new things effectively; therefore, they learn the second language as their mother tongue. I remember back then; the teacher that I cherish the most, Mr Ahmadi, told me \"Learn as much as you can since life becomes too busy later\". Secondly, is the gaining of more opportunities. Research shows that modern companies are always looking for someone special and so, bilinguals have more chances to be employed than monolinguals. For instance, a friend of mine that learnt French in early life acquired a fabulous internship position in a big France company; consequently, he achieved a valuable experience in his working life.",
        "There are two significant drawbacks to learning a foreign speech during the early stage of a juvenile's life. The first is irregularity. Most time, young children prefer playing games instead of learning a new speech; furthermore, the process of learning might be exhausting and frustrating for them; therefore, they may become disorganized in this process. On the other hand, another disadvantage is being disappointed in the journey of learning. Even though juveniles have a sharp mind, the process of learning may be challenging for them as a result, they may abandon the language learning process. In my point of view, we can solve these problems easily. For example, we are able to teach them with fun; consequently, this method of learning can attract young individuals and encourage them to learn it effectively.",
        "In conclusion, both views have their pros and cons but, in my perspective, the positive factors prevail much more."
