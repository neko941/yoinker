        "Nowadays, the increasing numbers of offspring would like to seek out their families\u2019 stories in some specific nations. There are numerous reasons why they do so. This essay will provide two compelling causes of this phenomenon and explain my opinion, which supports this development.",
        "To begin with, people reveal their families\u2019 histories because of finding their identities and making profits. Take France for example. French people have many vineyards that are belonged to one family in the long run. By realizing the family story, some young descendants can utilize history to promote their family business as well as identity and make a fortune. Their descendants might apply their family story by a special band of their wine and merchandise. Thus, finding the families\u2019 histories can be popular in some specific countries.",
        "Above all, it is a positive development that some people are keen on digging into their family history. Because the more offspring understand their histories, the more they can maintain their spirits as well as folklore and preserve the cultural heritage of the family. Take me for example. Before the full realization of Taiwanese history, I cannot realize why my grandmother soaked food, such as carrots, with a considerable amount of salt essential to keep food fresh and save money. In the past decade, Taiwanese people lived in a poor environment without freezers for food storage and wages to sustain their livestock. Thus, they used some salty ingredients to keep food in the harvesting season. Meanwhile, they can sell these agricultural products to earn money and improve their life qualities. By learning Taiwanese history, I can preserve the recipe and appreciate my ancient\u2019s wisdom. As a result, revealing family history is a bright trend to develop.",
        "In conclusion, knowing ancient\u2019s history is prevalent now. People can strengthen their identity, make revenue, and keep the culture and spirit of their family from one generation to another. Thus, it is a profoundly positive development in this contemporary era."
