Despite the fact that my performance was above expectations, they decided to terminate my job contract. Nonetheless, I don't have any other source of income to pay the money.",
        "In fact, I am trying hard to hunt for a new job so I can start my normal routine. Moreover, I would be able to get off this situation by the end of this month. Thus, I will pay off the rent for this and the next month together till then please bestow me an extension.",
