        "Parents are the first educators in children\u2019s lives. Both are responsible for caregiving and contributing to pupils \u2018personalities.  Therefore, a set of people think parents should read or tell stories to children, while some oppose it as children can read books or watch TV or movies by themselves. However, in this article, both views are discussed and will also explain why I support parental intervention is always important in children\u2019s  lives regardless of their age.",
        "Young offsprings deserve a healthy family environment as they are in their initial stage of developing a strong bond with their parents. Only Parents know how to teach basic language skills and moral values while reading  story books. For instance, once a child learns the consequences of telling a lie through the story then he or she will never do it in his/her own lifetime. Furthermore, while reading stories with children, they create their own fascinating world and are full of curiosity which is beneficial for their interpersonal development while expressing their emotions. Hence, Parents escalate their young ones learning ethics through reading stories loud with social characters, but modern stressful life pattern has tremendously taken over their parental role.",
        "Nowadays, parents must work very hard due to higher living costs and are unable to spend quality time with their kids. Consequently, kids are more exposed to electronic learning devices such as mobile games, cartoons, and kids\u2019 programs on television as result there will be serious health concerns later in their lives. For example, majority of the young children have lost eyesight, have neck, and spine deformities, and suffer from different  diseases at a very early age. Another important concern is that modern children dislike their parental intervention after a certain age. For example, after primary school, pupils have developed  learning skills and mingled with the same peer groups. Subsequently, they cultivate their independence with their own personal experiences despite learning from their parent\u2019s stories.",
        "To sum up, In my opinion, the  kinder age deserves parental support in learning and grasping the content of the stories and strengthening  their bond with their parents, while after the kinder age, pupils should allow learning  modern technology and interact with the same peers. Nevertheless, Parental supervision is still crucial for the healthy upbringing of their offspring as a compact family."
