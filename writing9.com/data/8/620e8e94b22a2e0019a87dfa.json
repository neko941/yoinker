        "Kindly be informed, that I have recently attended the culinary classes held at the \u201cPark Street\u201d last Thursday. I relished the various Non-veg cuisines learned during the class along with the cooking skills.",
        "Furthermore, recently I hosted a house-warming party at my place and invited friends and families. I prepared chicken curry learned during the session and it was fantabulous. I added lemon- juice with spring onion for garnishing salad and it was indeed the cherry on the cake. I received much appreciation and shared the recipe with others as well. Many of my friends were interested to know about your next schedule of the jam sessions.",
        "In addition, I would like to request you to schedule a cake baking classroom in the coming weeks as I have my daughter\u2019s birthday in the next month and I am very keen to bake a delicious chocolate cake and choco cookies for her and her friends. I will forward the timings with my acquaintances.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
