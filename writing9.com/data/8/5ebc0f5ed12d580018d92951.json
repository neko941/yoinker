        "There has been a growing concern about the similarity amongst countries as a result of globalization with goods and services being bought in any part of the world. Many people opine that globalization could cause detrimental effects, while others disagree on this view. In my opinion, I am firmly convinced that this trend has both advantages and disadvantages.",
        "There are several important benefits for a certain country when it comes to the free flow of products. One of the most significant impacts is that consumers are given more choices as the flow of goods and services is made easier than before making access to products more ready and available to shoppers. For instance, a man might buy sufficient furniture for his home online instead of moving from place to place. Furthermore, this trend has a significant positive effect on the national economic development. In fact, tariffs such as car or luxury item taxes would help improve the revenue for a country. For example, a Vietnamese buying an American car could at the same time contribute a certain amount of tax money to the nation.",
        "Although it is undeniable that globalization has some advantages, there are two major drawbacks of this situation. Apparently, local companies could go out of business due to the increasing number of multinational corporations breaking into the market. In other words, there would be higher competition for domestic manufacturers. Not only local business, but also the cultural beauty could be affected. Indeed, fast foods, movies, cars or cosmetic are usually the ideas of foreigners, which are very attractive to people with Xenophilia trait, making a person alien to his or her traditional culture.",
        "All things considered, I firmly believe that there are both good and bad things when it comes to the impact of globalization. Governments together with companies should do their parts to make sure positive developments outweigh the negative ones."
