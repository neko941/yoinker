        "Some people think that watching movies is a misuse of turn.  According to some people, watching movies is a waste of a generation. To a certain extent I disagree with this opinion as movies can be very informative. But not all of the films are helpful either to humanity.",
        "Good movies are considered as one of the most popular forms of entertainment and relaxation suitable for all age groups of society. To begin with, more useful movies to people can be educated and inspirational rather than just a waste of second. Apart from entertainment, there are many movies that are based on current society and environmental issue, family peace, patriotism, the lives of celebrities and their accomplishments, major historic events. Such, movies motivate ordinary and young people and have a huge impact on the society as well. For example, the movie, Vatan. The main events of these films took place during world war 2. On the day, it reflected how people experienced hardships and missed their homeland. People who watch these movie grow in their love for their homeland.",
        "On the other hand, not all of the films may be useful to people, especially for young people growing now. Because many films are shot in an aggressive spirit. The aggressive mental films can affect the behaviour of young people who waste present watching  movies. As a result, such children are unable to get along with their peers or those around them. So it will not always be useful to watch a movie.",
        "In conclusion, some people may vary in their views, but I think that watching movies is a useful activity as it provides education with entertainment."
