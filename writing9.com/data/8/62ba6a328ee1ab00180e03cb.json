        "There are those who argue that it is better for tertiary students to live a long way from their home than stay at home with their parents. In my opinion, there are both pros and cons to this view.",
        "In defence of this contention, there are all kinds of reasons, if you ask me, why it makes sense. For one thing, students who live independently will learn useful life skills. This is because they have to do their own cooking, cleaning, managing money, grocery shopping and the like. Myself is a classic example in this regard. I used to live on my own when I was studying at the university. I successfully managed both my life and study requirements.  On top of this, they may also get real work experience in part-time time jobs. Consequently, life will be much easier for them when they start their careers.",
        "Be that as it may, however, the negatives in relation to this idea are just as big, as far as I am concerned. Perhaps chief among these is that it is expensive. It may be too costly for many students to pay rent, as well as for food, transport, electricity and gas bills and so on. As well as this, if they have to cook, clean or take part-time time work, they have less time for their studies. For instance, students are under greater pressure these days because they have to attend lectures, prepare for exams, and complete assignments on time. This may affect their academic performance.",
        "Turning to my own experience, the way things are when it comes to this matter in my country, China, is much the same as it was across the world. My home city of Lanzhou is a textbook example in point.  Here, many students have to study very hard to get into good universities. At uni, they need to work even harder to achieve good academic records, which can help them to get decent jobs later on.",
        "At the end of the day, there are positive as well as negative aspects to all considerations in life. It  totally depends on their circumstances."
