        "In the modern world, education is a synonym for  success but some may argue differently. Even though there are examples in the arts and sports world where people have succeeded without having a university study but the number of such personalities is limited and hence it is agreed that  university learning is a must for a successful career.",
        "Firstly, people who have argued that academic study is not necessary, have erected their ideology based on the successful career of a few musicians and sports personalities. For example, football player Pele has achieved great heights purely based on his skill and without getting a proper college degree . Similar examples as well were noted in the field of music ,but people tend to forget that these heroes have made their careers based on their talent. Hence sometimes know-how trumps   literacy and greatness can be achieved.",
        "However, not all kids are talented and cannot earn their livelihood without proper qualifications. The majority of the population relies on a college degree to meet their end needs. Without the proper knowledge , a person will not be able to coup up with the highly competitive world and will eventually falter. For example, to get into the information industry it is mandatory to have a degree certificate ,  similarly in any corporate ,position proper education is mandatory.",
        "In conclusion, talent along with a proper education are both seldom found and there are situations where capability has an upper hand over the knowledge but it is a limited situation hence I agree that  university teaching is mandatory for every human being ."
