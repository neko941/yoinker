        "We were fortunate enough to  make the best use of the facilities at our disposal in the leisure house, firstly, as a couple every weekend we tapped our feet at Zumba classes. Secondly, my younger one had been learning cricket for a long time and the toddler has a whale of a time in the swimming pool. Lastly, my in-laws meet and greet people and read classic books. Moreover, every quarter we have a healthy carrom tournament with my buddies, which has enthusiastic participation.",
        "This is the only place in the vicinity which bridges the gap between the socio-economic groups and encourages them to network with  people from different walks of life. This place definitely helps in being fit and boosts knowledge sharing among the people.",
        "If this place closes then people will lose touch with each other, rather children will be glued to their smart gadgets, affect elderly being isolated, and working-class individuals may not find a place that acts as a stress buster. The overall well-being of the community will be impacted on a larger scale.",
        "Kindly request you to contemplate the decision and pass the verdict in our favour.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
