        "I have nothing to say about this problem as there are not any troubles with the capacity of the roads in our city. Nevertheless, I am going to write and explain some advantages and disadvantages of the system, when people should be taxed in  entering the city centre.",
        "It is clear that an increase in the number of automobiles can contribute to the appearance of traffic problems such as traffic congestion and even car accidents at rush hours. The reduction in its quantity due to taxation encourages manifestation of positive effects, as well as traffic jams ,are likely to occur less frequently. For instance, this policy also is possible to prevent environmental pollutions in  extensive cities over the world.",
        "However, in order to reduce the number of private cars, there are better ways to improve the quality of public transport. Not many inhabitances of cities are expected to practice the use of this transportation, as it is not the most convenient and the cleanest way to commute to the work or to the school on a daily basis. For example, if governments replace the old buses on new once and enhance the schedule of them, I think, the use of cars will immediately decrease. Also, there is an average 1 car on the one family, nonetheless the quantity of it would be reduced if there were more footpaths and squares for walking and cycling.",
        "From what has been discussed above here should be drawn a conclusion that this policy is meaningfulness and does not have benefits, which overweight disadvantages and the top alternative, a decision is just increased the rate of public transport and their services."
