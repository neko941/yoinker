        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing to express my view on the destruction of historical buildings in my locality. I recently got to hear that 'Livingstone museum' which is almost a kilometre away from my site is on the list. This museum has been here for a century and people have created unforgettable memories here; moreover, this place is the only source of raw history of the medieval period  and destroying it will ruin all its past and valuable history.",
        "For locals, this place has been an awesome source of business as tourists from different places come to visit and explore our past, tourists come here and  buy local handcrafts which represent our community and culture. However, in the last few ,decades the percentage of annual visitors has declined to 50% because of its poor infrastructure and maintenance.",
        "In order to finance the construction cost, we can do promotions online about this place to attract travellers, students and youth to come and explore the epic history of our culture. In addition, we can charge affordable fees for visiting the museum and will take a profit margin from local vendors and shopkeepers bi-weekly.",
        "Thanks for your consideration, looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "Yours faithfully",
