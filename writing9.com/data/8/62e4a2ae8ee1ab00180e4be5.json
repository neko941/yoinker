        "Nowadays, the rapid development of the internet is being widely witnessed. An increasing number of people are getting worldwide news from the Internet instead of reading newspapers. In this essay, I shall discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this trend and then illustrate why I believe the positive points surpass the negative aspects.",
        "There are numerous advantages associated with this development and the prominent one is that it enables us to enjoy convenience and efficiency as we can obtain the latest information on the Internet promptly and efficiently, disregarding the limits of location and time, as long as our electronic devices are connected to WIFI. Another crucial beneficial factor of this phenomenon is that it can significantly reduce the production of paper-based newspapers, which is attributable to the sustainable development of the environment. For example, a recent survey conducted in Japan revealed that the shrinking industry of newspapers led to fewer greenhouse gas emissions due to less demand for paper. As can be seen, those advantages have a profound impact on the community.",
        "However, every coin has two sides. One primary adverse consequence of this tendency is that the process of verification of information online is difficult for most individuals as fake news is prevalent online and vulnerable groups could be misled and deceived. In addition, some radical groups chose to incite violence and discrimination online, which is not conducive to the stability of society. For instance, many terror attacks were plotted and live-streamed by the offenders on various social media to affect the gullible. Therefore, the public could be negatively impacted by the drawbacks of this trend.",
        "Accessing the world through the Internet instead of newspapers for people is ubiquitous these days. This essay discussed both the virtues and downsides of this trend and taking everything into consideration, I am inclined to say that the overall benefits are superior."
