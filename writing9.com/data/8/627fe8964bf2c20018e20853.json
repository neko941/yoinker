        "People nowadays are sleeping lesser than their previous generations. Increasing working hours and a change in lifestyle are the main reasons behind this. I feel this is a negative development in the long run as it results in serious health issues among individuals.",
        "Most individuals are working longer than ever and it is the primary reason that they are getting lesser bedtime. Today's jobs have become very competitive and people now need to spend extra hours getting their work done, and as a result, they cut down on their sleeping hours to make that extra time for their work. For example, most IT jobs require individuals to stretch longer than 10-12 hours daily and they get to sleep lesser than normal. Secondly, the living style of overall society has changed where sleeping lesser has become a norm. To exemplify, folks across every age group now tend to stick to their mobile screens till late at night connecting with friends or watching movies, attend late-night parties etc., and thus don't get enough time to sleep properly.",
        "This shift in sleeping patterns is detrimental to the overall health of our present population. Many people who continue to sleep lesser develop chronic diseases such as hypertension, insomnia etc. In addition, they tend to weaken their power to focus as their mind is mostly exhausted without proper rest and sleep, which is essential for everyone's good health. For instance, we feel fresh and rejuvenated  after a good nap at end of the day else we feel frustrated in case we miss out on our sleep regularly.  This results in individuals deteriorating their health over time.",
        "To conclude, the present population has started cutting down on their sleeping quota due to rising work hours and changing living habits. In the long run, this shift can cause more harm than good as people can severely damage their health due to lack of sleep."
