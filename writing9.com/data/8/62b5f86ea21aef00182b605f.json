        "Dear Mrs Johns,",
        "I am Haniye Sarabi and I am writing to express my desire to be a member of your outstanding team for this year\u2019s local cuisines festival. Last year, I attended  the festival taken place at the central park in September with my mother. We were coming back from an afternoon jogging and the electrified crowd caught our attention. As we approached, we became shocked by the festival being held and all the tempting international colourful dishes at the booths. Everything was significantly well-organized from the music, food, people of your team,etc. I followed Instagram of the festival and realized the credit goes to you.",
        "To begin with, I am from Iran and Persian foods are hard to neglect. Needless to say, I am an expert at cooking local Persian meals such as Kobideh, Tahchin, Ghorme sabzi, etc. Since Canada offered the opportunity to myriad ethics to live alongside. I believe food festivals are the best approach to touch other immigrants' cultures. Persian is the fourth spoken language in Vancouver, I would be pleased if I could have the chance to participate in your group to provide Persian dishes.",
        "Additionally, I would like to ask you about the estimated time this year\u2019s festival is going to be held and the location you are considering for this. Could you please let me know if there is a place for me to volunteer as a Persian representative?",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you.",
