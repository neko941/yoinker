        "Recently, plenty of individuals choose to migrate to big cities. I firmly believe that this trend brings several demerits to the environment such as air pollution and mass waste.",
        "To begin with, harmful air condition is caused by the crowded population in big cities. To be specific, there are numerous vehicles driving on the roads, meaning that cars emit exhaust gas into the air, which makes air conditioning become worse. For instance, individuals drive their private cars to work or shopping instead of walking by themselves or taking public transportation, so this has badly changed the environment. Therefore, a higher population in big cities brings more vehicle activities that turn the environment worse than before.",
        "Furthermore, a growing trend of the population in big cities brings massive waste. As people expect a convenient life, they use various types of containers to carry out foods or drinks, and use different materials to pack goods, indicating that they produce a huge amount of waste. Additionally, the rubbish might be dropped by residents on the street and going anywhere by the wind. In other words, huge rubbish is produced, and the landfill\u2019 capacity will not have enough space for waste; hence, people have to obtain more landfill for their waste to destroy the environment. Thus, the environment suffers from the amount of rubbish that is bought by people who live in the big capital.",
        "To sum up, people migrate to big cities for many purposes but they also bring plentiful serious issues that increase waste and air pollution to the environment."
