I checked online that all the books can be borrowed from your library. Therefore, I decide to apply for a library card.",

Because my thesis will be due on next month, I would like to get my library card and start reading the books as soon as possible. Please let me know all the procedures for application, and I will get all the materials ready and file my application.",
