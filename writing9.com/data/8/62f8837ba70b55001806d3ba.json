        "Dear John,",
        "Hope you are in good spirits. I am Jen, and I happened to attend one of your concerts held at Oberoi Stadium in Pittsburg on 22nd August. I am writing to tell you how I felt about your performance. Let me tell you in detail.",
        "Truth to tell, I was really looking forward to your concert. I have been following your Youtube channel since my college days and you are the reason that I got interested in music so much. Following your steps, I  then enrolled myself in a music school where I  learned to play instruments like guitar and piano. I have been practising for the last 5 years now and have also been able to perform at Hard Rock cafe during weekends.",
        "Recently, I thought of recording an album of my own. Luckily, I came across your program where you teach and nurture new talent so that later they can be a part of your band. I really want to get into this program to develop my career this. I am sharing a few recordings of my solo performance with you in this letter. Hope you go through them and consider me for your project.",
        "Looking forward to hearing from you.",
