        "Population learning online is becoming more popular in modern society. As the network development, it brings convenient study, however, I believe that education online has some benefits and drawbacks compared to face-to-face classrooms.",
        "On the one hand, the technique improvement brings some advantages to online studying which do not exist in traditional lessons. First of all, it is easier to learn everything whatever the location nation stay in or the language they speak, one thing they need just to connect internet. Moreover, in recent years, free Wi-Fi is around public areas such as coffee shops and train stations, which brings convenience for people who are waiting for friends or travelling to another city. By contrast, online learning is freer and therefore they can choose the time which is suitable for them to learn or develop their own skills. In addition, many specific courses are provided on some online education platforms which are beneficial for workers with relative jobs to gain much deeper knowledge.",
        "On the other hand, online improvement platform also has some drawbacks. One reason for that is nations have to be self-control, not only that but also time manager, otherwise, it is going to waste their time. Also, many online lessons are recorded and therefore no one will monitor students, pupils easily lose concentration while they are taking the courses via the internet. More importantly, one thing that cannot be instead by online classes is asking questions. For example, when learners attend the course at present, they can ask questions directly, unlikely, online students have to search for the answers by using google or email to their teachers, then get the answers which might be incorrect or take a period of time.",
        "In conclusion, learning through online schooling systems can show network and technique improvements, and it also has many pros and cons of its educational methods."
