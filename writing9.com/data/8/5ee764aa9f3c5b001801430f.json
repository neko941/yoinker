        "Economy is the backbone of any country for its development and countries are continuously making an effort to be economically strong. Some people believe that extended working hours can help the countries to grow from an economic point of view compared to the countries those have average working hours. I am against this opinion and will share the reasons in the following paragraphs.",
        "The most persuasive reason is related to the health of the residents. Working for longer hours can impact the well-being of the people and lead to diseases like, stress and fatigue. Furthermore, it is commonly believed that prolonged working hours are associated with the higher salaries but stressed people. When higher salaries help to boost the economy, unwell people contribute towards the downscale of the economy. For example, a recent study by the Medical Research Institute in United States has stated that the stress level of people in developing countries has been increased from the past few decades due to stretched working hours.",
        "Another substantial reason is related to the quality of life. Citizens of developed countries have the work-life balance and at the same time they tend to enjoy their life. Moreover, enterprises have equipped themselves with the advanced machineries and latest technologies to increase the productivity of the workforce. In addition to this, Governments also support their people with labour laws. For instance, countries like Finland and Spain have a substantial economic growth in spite of having less than average working hours.",
        "In conclusion, prolonged working hour is the prime factor for the economic growth of countries is a debatable issue. In my viewpoint, extending working hours is not the key to success of economic growth, whereas healthy nationals with the help of good infrastructure can turn the economy of the country to a great success."
