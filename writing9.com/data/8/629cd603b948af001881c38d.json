She is extremely good at team-building, time management and leadership. Besides, she always offers creative ideas. Hence, immediately after her internship, She was been offered a full-time job. She has helped our company to take the next level. In fact, She has received three promotions during her five years of career span. Since Areeza is now moving to her home country, She is looking for a new job opportunity. In my opinion, Areeza will be a good asset to the company and I am sure she will help your agency to take the next level with her creative ideas.",
