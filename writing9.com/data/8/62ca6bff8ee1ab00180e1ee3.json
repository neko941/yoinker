        "This is with regards to the reader contribution section for the article about a book that influenced me the most. I wanted to provide you with the book that inspired me the most.",
        "I recently read a novel called 'Be Fit' by Bruce Wayne. In this book, the author had given insights on how various health issues are causing obesity in today's working class, especially people aged between 30-40. Since people are not concentrating on health, it is resulting in a lot of injuries or even an untimely death in certain cases. The novelist has provided ways and means to tackle this health issue and get back on track with a healthy life. It inspired me and nudged me in the direction to seek  a healthier life. Firstly, I decided to follow all the principles mentioned in the book like having 8 hours of sleep and going for regular walks. Secondly, I followed the diet mentioned in the book along with proper exercise which has helped to reduce almost 24 pounds in the last 3 months.",
        "I believe this book is a real blessing in disguise for today's generation who do not prioritise their health over other materialistic things in life and can motivate them on their fitness journey.",
        "Please let me know if you want more information about my fitness transformation.",
        "Thanking you.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
        "Peter Parker."
