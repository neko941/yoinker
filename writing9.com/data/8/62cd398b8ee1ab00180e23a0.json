        "The government is the biggest organisation in every country. They receive an income from a tax of society. The government can fund in various situations, whether in arts, music, and theatre. However, public services should be funded by the government instead. In my opinion, I totally agree with this argument. I will give an explanation below.",
        "Firstly, public services are the main infrastructure in our society. Funding public services can improve the quality of people's life whereas in urban or the capital city. Moreover, this can improve the economy of the country. For instance, a modern transportation system can help people spend their time shorter when travelling. Also, can minimize the accident from power lines by making an underground system. Thus, developing infrastructure can lead to a good liveable city.",
        "Secondly, Funding for public services helps various groups of people ,especially disabled people and orphans. This group of people is a majority group that should help immediately. So, the public services can increase their opportunity to find a job. For example, in cleaning the city, we can employ this group of people to help with some small tasks although they can not do complex tasks. So, this can benefit both government and disabled people. The government can achieve tasks quickly and disabled people gain revenue from it.",
        "In conclusion, public services are an important investment of the government because it related to infrastructure. So, this will improve the quality of life. Also, this can adapt to help the disabled community and orphans."
