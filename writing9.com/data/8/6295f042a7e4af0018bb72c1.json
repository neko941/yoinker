Since the place is the oldest capital, it has the oldest buildings with high-quality architecture, many archaeological museums, and traditional foods.",
        "There are a lot of guided tours like ETX tourism that I strongly recommend that you can join and learn  much correct information about the metropolis. Guided tours give you a good opportunity to ascertain the soul of the metropolis.",
