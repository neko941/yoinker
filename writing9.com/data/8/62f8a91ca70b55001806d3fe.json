        "In current times, there is global advancement in technology in almost every field of work. This can also be seen in the gaming industry which then creates a new market for computer games. Therefore, children are more inclined to play on the desktop rather than playing outdoor games. In this essay, I will discuss why kids are playing more laptop games and why,I think, this is a positive development.",
        "Offsprings these days are more attracted to playing on the computer because of the technological advancement in the computer gaming industry. Moreover, due to ,technology they get first-hand experience and therefore, feel the adrenaline rush while playing interactive games such as counterstrike, pubg etc. For instance, while playing a subway surfer, children experience the speed and thrill of racing which they are legally not allowed to, in real life. This can lead to positive as well as negative development of a child\u2019s mind.",
        "However, I believe, this is a positive improvement in many ways. While playing interactive video games kids are able to develop various motor as well as mental abilities at an early age. For example, if a child plays a game named counterstrike, they tend to develop skills like better hand and mind coordination along with teamwork, strategy implementation and a competitive attitude to win the game. Furthermore, this enhances the abilities of children at an early age and helps them to succeed in real life.",
        "In conclusion, technological advancement in video games attracts children to play more games. This not only develops their motor skills like hand and mind coordination but also develops mental abilities like teamwork, strategy development, and competitive attitude."
