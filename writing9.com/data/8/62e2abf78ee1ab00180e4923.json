        "In the contemporary epoch, there is an irrefutable debate concerning the submission of numerous jeopardies in life. A group of folk asserts that taking risks has a crucial role in future prospects. My perspective is that the merits outweigh demerits ,and my reason will be elaborated on in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, the most preponderant is that beyond doubt realistic compliance with copious hazards could be conducive to success in the diverse segments of life. In other words, the more people assent to precarious circumstances, the faster they are more likely to keep ahead in their social statuses ranging from financial areas and job positions. It means that creating new opportunities entails avoiding steady and static procedures. A recent study done by Tehran University is an excellent example of this issue. It clearly shows that the achievements of illustrious administrators are the consequences of colossal risky policies and guidelines. Needless to say, all these competencies stand out in good stead as far as augmenting the chances of prosperity is concerned.",
        "On the flip side of the coin, another pivotal factor in the aforementioned proposition is that it could bring about failure. Indeed, dangers that have been determined without any boundaries inspire defeats. Consequently, not only do these risks not have definite indexes but they also are not opted  proportional to capacity by the majority of people. For instance, according to submitted official statistics in 2022 in France, the causes of the collapse of immense corporations are associated with the hazardous decisions of managers during economic crisis and inflation. Therefore, the drawbacks of the stated topic are undeniable.",
        "In conclusion, according to the forenamed quarrel, although there are various non-negligible adverse impacts of taking risks, the beneficial advantages in it outweigh the ill effects."
