        "I was coming back home after my long afternoon shift at work. After exiting the elevator and while approaching the entrance to my apartment, I realised that my neighbour is standing in front the door. It was apparent that he was drunk. First, I politely asked him to let me enter my flat. He did not react and just continued blocking access to the door. Next, since it was clear that he was not going to listen to reason, I decided to try to bypass him. That is when he hit my head with a bottle that he was holding in his right hand, after which he collapsed and consequently fell asleep right on the floor.",
        "As of now, he is still sleeping outside, so I would like you to come and remove him, and press corresponding charges in accordance with local criminal law. I hope that you can make sure that this kind of situation does not repeat with him.",
