        "Secondly, I will explain what we do to our neighbourhood. We don't charge for our performances, but we accept donations. The donations that we collect, go to the child health care foundation of our council. Child health care foundation maintains the public park, where our children play in the evenings. Moreover, they conduct tutorials, by spending the money that we offer them.",
        "Though we continue to do good work, with the new timetable of the community hall, we are facing difficulty to continue our practices. We met every Tuesday and Friday in the audio room to do our practices. I kindly request from you,  consider our good work and make necessary arrangements to get us back on our training.",
        "I would appreciate your kind attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you.",
