        "Last month, I applied for Post graduate diploma in management  and I am very curious when I got a letter from your side that contains a  document stating that my application is accepted by the college. Even though a scholarship is also provided to me because of my good marks in the last program.",
        "I wish to study this subject as I want to prepare myself for this field and want to be a Manager in future. However, after a few days,  I came to know that my father has got a promotion and we have to move to another city because of his seniority. I also have to accompany my parents as I am not able to do my household chores alone, which is why I cannot attend classes at this institute.",
        "I want to pursue this course and want you to please let me know if I am eligible to apply for this course  next year as I will be back in this city by the upcoming year. In addition to it, I also want to  inquire if I got that scholarship at that time or not.",
        "Hope to get a reply from your side.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
