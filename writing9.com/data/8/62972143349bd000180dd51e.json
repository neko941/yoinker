        "Dear Joseph,",
        "I write you this letter to answer your question as to whether it's suitable for you.",
        "Firstly, I like camping, exploring and discovering nature and walking through the trees. I've got a lot of experience because I've done this many times. At night the stars shine, the landscape is fantastic, the water of the rivers makes me rest and I feel like a living person.",
        "Secondly, there are a few little things I've to be aware of. During the day the sun sometimes gets hotter and you know there's no air conditioning, while at night it can get cold. As long as you live in the city, you won't notice any insects because of the pest control. However, near the campsite, you'll see many insects that live in the forest. Some insects can poison you, others can bite you. Although some of them are harmless, others are dangerous.",
        "Of course, I'd like to accompany you because I love camping near the river, especially in summer.",
        "Best regards."
