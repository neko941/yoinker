        "Nowadays, the majority of people are more cautious about the history of the house they are about to inhabit there. There are some specific reasons behind this approach such as religious beliefs. However, coming to this realization is not bound to be easy since the owner of the building might not tell the truth as well as the neighbourhood.",
        "Moving to a new house whether by purchasing or renting, can be extremely challenging for some families. Even though the house might be enormously astonishing and rewarding enough to settle in, some parents are not going to select that place as a roof over their head. One of the most significant reasons is religious and social belief. To be more exact, some people\u2019s faith is that they had better not live in a house where the prior residents had a different religion from theirs. Therefore, they need to seek a place where only their peers have been living there previously. Another possible reason might be the beliefs about the experiences of the previous inhabitant. An example to illustrate this point is about the people who had died in that house before. If that specific dead person had been living a dignified life, the house is considered a suitable and proper place to live in, otherwise, the house will be rejected. Due to these explanations, some people are not going to live in any places since they have some strong faith about the accommodations.",
        "However, it is obviously easier said than done. It would be exceedingly arduous to find out a proper place to live since discovering the history of the houses is partly challenging. One theory that possibly explains this idea is that the owner of the house is not bound to tell every detail of things honestly. They are probably keen on selling the house at any cost, irrespective of the requests of the applicant. In some circumstances, buyers would try to inquire about the record of the house from neighbours. However, the words heard from neighbours are not going to reveal the reality. In light of this evidence, it is crystal clear that figuring out the historical events related to the house is not going to be easy and in all likelihood, people will come up with some burdens in their way.",
        "In conclusion, in spite of the fact that a specific number of societies are enthusiastic about the history of the house they are going to live in, it would be indubitably formidable to decipher the reality and secrets behind the house."
