        "The problem I am having is that  the railing quality is poor and not in good condition but your pup always trying to jump over the barbed wire. Last week, your pup jumped on it and broke it. Apart from this issue, we will fix the new rail instead of repairing the  one old. I think  it will solve the problem that your puppy makes. First, we will see different fences such as  rigid steel with good quality so it will stay up to last long. I know, the price of it is a bit high but it will only solve the issue between us.",
        "I want to suggest you  give me half price of the bar because your puppy gives that expenses but I think it will solve after putting new shade.",
