        "Leadership skills are thought by some to be inherited qualities, whereas others believe in order to be a powerful person it needs a lifetime experience and determination. In this essay I will discuss both views and why I believe that leadership qualities are acquired after an educational process and the right training.",
        "It is often argued that a guidance personality is normally gifted from the ancestors. They rely on a belief that some sort of characteristics such as confidence and self- esteem are passed down through generations. Ultimately, those skills help an individual to excel on early age. As long as a person started to succeed from an early stage, it will sustain because success breeds success. For example, it has been proven that 20% of the most powerful politicians acquired that from their parents. Thus, a successful parent will produce a successful child.",
        "However, I agree with those how believe that in order to be a motivational character is really a challenging matter. In fact, it has nothing to do with genetic factors at all because if a person combined his experience and an appropriate training, he would definitely stand out of the crowd. For example,  even though James Brown has been raised in a low income family, after receiving an intensive course and educational programs he became an owner of the most powerful, successful company. As a result, anyone is able to attain his desired goal  by gaining knowledge and education.",
        "In conclusion, although it could be advocated by some that guiding skills are inborn gifts. I strongly believe that the combination of motivational and successful characteristics can be gained only via exposure to the correct training programs."
