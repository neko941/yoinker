        "Dear Miss. Chevrolet,",
        "I'm writing this to thank you for the Spring Cookery Course that you have designed for home-cook recipes and compelling diverse cuisine from Northern Brazil. I have joined  this course from the first day to learn by heart many savoury dishes and kitchen tips.",
        "On my first day, Miss. Emma, our teacher  kindly introduced the secrets of butter used during cooking foods. This is useful by increasing beef smells and reducing salts from salted butter. We have collaborated to make an excellent competition in order to study  recipes and the meal representation. Meanwhile, I found that these unfortunate ranks will be repeated in the next semester with similar lessons and attendance instructors. I so loved the teaching methods of Miss. Emma. And, I'd be happy to the women's organization will offer the new cookery course with her.",
        "All students from Miss. Emma collection whose are strongly agreed about barkery collection from this program. I am happy to receive getting back about your idea and my pleasure to be a participant.",
        "Sincerely,",
