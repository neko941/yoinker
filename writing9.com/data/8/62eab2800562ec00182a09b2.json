        "In the end, the chef suggested trying the restaurant's special delicious dessert which was cooked with all the seasonal fruits and dry fruits. Moreover, the cake was offered for free since, it was a birthday. We are extremely pleased with the service provided by your staff. I should appreciate the job done by Mr Oscar who served the food.",
