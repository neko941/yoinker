        "It is asserted by some people that the students of institutions study subjects which they are interested in. However, some individuals convince that they should just educate in the fields which are practical in future.Both sides present logical arguments which will be elucidated, followed by my own take on the matter.",
        "On the one hand, studying whatever they enjoy in it takes priority in some people's opinion. The first compelling reason is that person's employability. In other words, when students accomplish their tasks out of interest in their subjects, they can be widely successful and have impressive results.This in turn paves the way for upcoming opportunities to have a job in their favourite major.An example of this situation is a kind and energetic nurse who has chosen this major at university because she enjoys it.Thereby,She fulfils her rules in the best and correct way.Moreover, a sense of satisfaction and self-conscientiousness is important. To put it another way, when the pupils love what they study,they full with a plethora of contentment also causes an intense rise in one's self-reliance.",
        "However, others advocate the idea of studying what is useful for their future.To begin with, more chances of employment can have in the future. Under this circumstance, the students not only have no difficulties financial but also  can accommodate the cost of living effortlessly.Take a doctor ,Who is not interested in a hospital, as an example;his material possession is more than they think.This person would no longer have problems with making a living.Furthermore, society's demand is of importance. Simply put, some fields are vacancy as well as the country needs professional people for them.Therefore, by educating these practical subjects, they can  eliminate these requirements.",
        "To conclude, I would tend to side with those who support students that study whatever they are interested in.It seems because of financial problems and the community needs some people choose to educate what is needed for the future."
