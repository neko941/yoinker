        "I am writing in regard to  provide my recent visit to your hotel from 15th -25th July 2022. I appreciate the services provided by your resort ,Meanwhile I would like to  draw your attention to some areas that require improvement.",

The rooms were spacious and hygienic and the pleasant ambience,but the pool area was found to be unclean, with lots of fungus patches at the corners of the pool. Lastly, the room service staff isn't prompt and unresponsive over the phone.",
