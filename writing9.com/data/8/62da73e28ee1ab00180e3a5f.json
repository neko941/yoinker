        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "Since you have asked to contribute to your upcoming article in the magazine 'Global Times', I am writing to share my feedback for a book that really influenced me.",
        "The book is called \"The Fit Indian\", and it is written by the very famous fitness and nutrition coach, \"Vishnu Mohan\". Because it is a road map to the ultimate fit body, the methods and techniques shared are super easy to follow, which is why it is one of the bestsellers in India.",
        "Firstly, the author talks about how he transformed himself with dedication and hard work, and it is pretty relatable. After reading the book, I was able to identify my weak areas, and why I crave fast food. The one method that was really interesting was the HIIT method, which stands for High-Intensity Interval Training.",
        "Undoubtedly, people have many health issues these days, and it has become extremely important to make them aware of their faulty dietary habits which are a part of their sedentary lifestyle. Both of these are included in the book, and hence, it must be a good read for people who have no clue where to start their fitness journey from. I certainly believe this would be a positive influence on people all around the globe.",
        "I hope my feedback will be valuable to you.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
