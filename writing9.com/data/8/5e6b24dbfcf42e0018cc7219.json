A good illustration of this is diseases and emergencies, such as viruses and forest fires. For example, due to mass media the information about the Coronavirues is spread across the world, which is beneficial for the world population, because as soon as they receive news about the COVID-19, they immediately started actions in order to avoid the negative outcomes.",

In this reason, the majority of people believe that the last option is not harmful for the people."
