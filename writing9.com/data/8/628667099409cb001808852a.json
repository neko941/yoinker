        "It is often discussed whether parents hiring someone to babysit their child while they are working is a positive or a negative solution. The paragraphs below will state why leaving a babysitter at home is advantageous to both adults and youngsters.",
        "To begin with, the main reason why asking someone to look after a youngster is favourable is because it gives the chance to both father and mother grow in their professions. To illustrate, it is considered common in some nations to women accept motherhood, and to take care of the house and raise the children, reaffirming a sexist society concept model. As a result, many women are financially dependent of their partners and spend their lives frustrated. Therefore, hiring a mother's helper would allow the couple to achieve their goals related to their careers independently and be professionally fulfilled.",
        "Furthermore, another cogent motive to justify why a babysitter would be helpful and beneficial to a family's household functioning is the assistance to the child's development. For instance, although it is obvious to think that a childcare facility would be an optimal solution, a myriad of infants are enrolled in it, and there is the possibility of not every student receiving proper attention. Hence, a qualified caregiver could teach lessons, use playful games and be sure that any illness manifestation is not appearing, thus, working as a close ally of parents.",
        "To conclude, undoubtedly, employing a responsible person to look after the children while parents work is advantageous as it enables both adults to be financially and professionally independent, as well as maintain the child's interaction, mental development and health vigilance."
