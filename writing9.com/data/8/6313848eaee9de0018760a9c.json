        "With the advent of consumerism, material possessions and items have a stringent impact on the way people perceive each other and themselves. The kind of clothes we wear plays a dramatic role in enhancing or demeaning our interaction with others. I completely agree with the aforementioned statement and the following essay provides enough evidence to support this claim.",
        "Firstly, the behaviour of a person is massively inspired by what they are currently wearing. An expensive dress generally, but not necessarily, brings about a type of arrogance and a sense of pride for the one who is using it. Such people usually tend to consider highly of themselves in comparison with others around them. For instance, when I wore a fancy suit to my cousin's wedding last week, it made me feel superior to the folks next to me. Thus our outlook has a dominating effect on our interaction with others.",
        "On the other hand, clothes can play a positive role in enhancing the productivity of a person, especially in a professional setting. As an example, a school uniform has a great role to play in the discipline of children at the school. Similarly, a military uniform facilitates both courage and patience in an army officer that is necessary to execute his duties. Hence clothes play a vital role in designing our mindset.",
        "In conclusion, our attitude is constantly dictated by our appearance. Even though, it has got a few drawbacks that might hold us behind, it certainly has the power to bring about the best in us."
