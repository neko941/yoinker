        "Nowadays, some people believe that the way people network and make new friends has been changed by modern technologies, although others think that this development makes them more socially isolated. So, technology can be used for efficient communication but at the same time hinders people's face-to-face contact. In this essay, I will explain my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, many people are now addicted to their smartphones or laptops that have different free applications and websites like Instagram, Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype and so on. For instance, Facebook helps users to build community groups of like-minded people that can share their thoughts and take practical steps on real social problems and messengers and WhatsApp have made communication and friendship very easy because people can pass messages, documents, voice recording, and pictures. As the result, people build new friendships and maintain them by sending out messages or making voice calls frequently.",
        "On the other hand, technology improves communication, and has some negative effects. First of all, there has been a drastic reduction in face-to-face communication. As a result, the bonding between family members is reduced. And then, technology is actually building up fake relationships. For example, nowadays most adults and children are focused on to their phones and avoid talking directly or meeting family members that is actually lowers the need to meet people and makes people less social.",
        "In conclusion, I personally feel that we have been helped by advances in technology in many ways, but they have a detrimental effect on communication, especially among family members. It would be safer for people to avoid using gadgets when they are with family, particularly on situations such as lunch or homemade parties."
