This letter is with regards to the bill of July 2022 in which I  noticed about the charges imposed for international calling that has not done by me, therefore writing you to complain about the same.",
        "I used the phone solely for local calls and messages  this month, in fact for three months I have not done any calls outside the country. Moreover,  I have checked with other members of my family but no one else has done it  , and that can be seen in the call history records.",
        "In view of the above, It seems these charges have been mistakenly added to my bill, therefore I would request you to verify the records again  and help me with the revised bill after withdrawing the unjustified charges.",
        "I am looking forward to your confirmation on this matter at the earliest.",
