        "In recent years, people compare about going to the university either domestically or internationally. Several years ago, people pursued their higher education in their home country but nowadays, there is a chance for the domestic students studying overseas. There are several benefits and drawbacks that will be regarding to that situation.",
        "First of all, students can receive many advantages by studying abroad. They can have new experiences that they might not get in their home country and they can also broad their social life by knowing the people that come from the country. Moreover, the opportunity to explore another country's culture is open. As an example, they can share a story about their country and they may show the dance or music that is popular in their country and they can learn from it. By that, students can get new insights and knowledge that can wider their thoughts about the world.",
        "However, there are also some disadvantages if all of the people use their chance to study abroad. The domestic university will have lack of students. For instance, only half of the capacity of the campus is occupied and they hard to find another high school student because the students tend to stick with their mind that study overseas is better than in their home country. As a result, it will have a huge impact on the university's economic and reputation. The university will not be able to survive, such as hard to pay the wages for the teachers and their big names can also be in danger.",
        "In conclusion, there are positive and negative effects resulted in the development of study abroad. Even though people can experience new life there and their broad knowledge about the variety in types of culture, the domestic university can be harmed as they are likely to have only a few students."
