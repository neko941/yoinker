        "In the contemporary epoch,There is irrefutable debate among folk about learning vernacular even in this fast-paced world where computers can translate these with much ease.There are some individuals who argue that in the next decade our kids will not have  difficulties  learning languages. I completely disagree with this view and the reasons for this statement will be discussed in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with , It is true that  artificial intelligence has been upgraded in a way that nobody could think about it a year ago, as far as the range of tongues is concerned , there are 18000 different languages and the technology can just translate some of them.To cite an example,According to a recent survey, In African countries people widely speak 17 languages but google can translate two of them.As a result, The necessity of translation can never be wiped out even in the next two decades.",
        "On the other hand, If technological advancement would be able then our kids will not focus on these imperative things and obviously,this trend would root out our ancestor's cultures related to the various tongues. For instance, In the past, the Chinese language was widely popular in schools but due to translation , and apps the traditions of Chinese are continuously decreasing.However, this trend has undeniable impacts on human beliefs.",
        "In the nutshell, I strongly believe that the imperativeness of learning various mother tongues  can never end because, Firstly, our modern science is currently unable to translate all of these and secondly, It is a devastating sign for traditions."
