        "I am writing this letter to you  know a vacant job which is a junior post for the fibre planning department in my company and I think you might be fit this role.",
        "First and foremost, since this post is for fibre planning, job scopes such as fibre routing generating, and attending to site surveys will be involved. Furthermore, you may need to coordinate with customers and sub-contractors regarding fibre installation. In addition, reporting the daily work process of the orders to associate managers and other tasks assigned by managers will be involved.",
        "Although, there are a lot of responsibilities that you may need to do, this post is open for entry-level and seniors will give the training about the tasks. Therefore, this role is appropriate for you since you don\u2019t have work experience and you can learn about not only the task but also onsite experience.",
        "I would like to suggest you apply directly from the company carrier website instead of applying from other employment agencies.",
