        "Education is the fundamental building block for children\u2019s development. However, the growth of students is very much dependent on the way of coaching. Some prefer educating students at home while others think it is necessary for children to attend school. In this essay, I will analyse both viewpoints before reaching a reasonable conclusion.",
        "There are groups of people who consider homeschooling has many benefits for a child\u2019s growth. For instance, a student studying at home can get personal attention from parents which results in good academic results. Furthermore, parents are aware of their child\u2019s weaknesses and can help him to cope with difficulties. Thus, it can be said that children can learn their subjects at the pace at which they are comfortable and this can help them to excel in their studies.",
        "On the other hand, many consider schools as the required element in student growth. Educational institutions, for example, concentrate on teaching moral values like tolerance and sharing along with studies. Moreover, they are encouraged to perform tasks in a team, enabling them to learn teamwork and not to dishearten by failure. Therefore, the chances of suffering from depression are reduced to a greater extent in case he doesn\u2019t get what he desired in the real world.",
        "From the above, it can be seen that both  viewpoints have their own merits. However, I tend to believe that in order to sustain in the actual world, students should be motivated to get educated in institutions rather than learning alone at home. It is thus hoped that the government will enforce strict laws for attendance in school compulsory."
