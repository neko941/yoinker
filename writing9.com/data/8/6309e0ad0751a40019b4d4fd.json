        "It has been argued that, nowadays, an increasing number of people have taken up to decipher the history of the building that they reside in. This essay will describe the possible reasons for such a trend in conjunction with the procedures for gaining related information.",
        "To begin with, in some communities, residents tend to find out the date of construction of their building because of the fact that the past of a structure is crucial to apt for the most appropriate method for its maintenance and repair. For example, aged buildings that were not built based on standard engineering regulations  should be reinforced by ultra-modern methods in order to become safer.",
        "Following this, house owners can acquire information about the past of their property from some related organisations such as the mayoralty of that region. In many urban areas, the documents correlated with engineering works that were done in previous decades still exist in mayoralties. By contrast, if there is not any information, they can ask an expert to give them  data about the history of their building. in fact, some specialized engineers can estimate the date of construction of a house by considering some factors such as materials being used and the style of the construction.",
        "In conclusion, lately, people have been keen on finding out the history of their house so as to devise a viable method for its maintenance and repair in order to make them more immune. Furthermore, they can get this data by asking different organizations or experts."
