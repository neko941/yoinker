        "Let me explain the whole experience in more detail. Firstly, On my 20th birthday, I was lucky to get a free ticket to spend my holidays at Zumba camp which you wish to visit now.I had the best three days of my entire life and I'm not exaggerating. Secondly, Zumba camp has the best waterfall you can ever wish for. It also has some other features which include a boat cruise, a mini zoo, and of course football!!.",
        "However, I didn't enjoy my nights due to the constant noise from their generator and they have a bad chef.These are some of the drawbacks of the camp although it should not discourage you.",
        "Can I suggest that we go together for the holiday together? I'd love a second visit and moreover, I know my way around. Let me know what you think so I can be able to start preparing on time.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
