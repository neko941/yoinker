        "I am writing to you in regards to the beginner\u2019s french classes at your school. My name is Hannah and I enrolled for the course two weeks ago in the time slot of 5-6 in the evening.",
        "The course primarily focuses on teaching french speaking and writing to beginner-level students and there are about 30 students enrolled in this class.",
        "However, I am not benefitting from the course completely. Firstly, the course started 1 week ago before I joined so I don\u2019t completely understand the fundamentals. Secondly, there is no practical speaking session, the teacher only focuses on delivering lectures. Lastly, no tests are being conducted for evaluation.",
        "I personally think students should be enrolled in the classes from day 1 and not added in the middle of the course. In addition to that, there should be speaking and writing assignments for students which will boost their confidence. Next, there should be biweekly or monthly tests to evaluate so the teacher and the students, can know where they stand.",
        "I hope you will give immediate attention to this matter.",
        "Yours sincerely",
