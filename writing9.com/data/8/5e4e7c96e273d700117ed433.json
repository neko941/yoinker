        "Pt\\resently, with the increasing in population the public is showing interest in constructing the new buildings. Besides, these people feel that they had to invest a lot of money in seeing and modifying a building. In this essay, I disagree with this viewpoint and suggest my opinion.",
        "",
        "Interestingly, people are interested in demolishing the ancient buildings and they want to construct a building with the modern facilities. While it may help them in achieving their goals, they were causing a huge damage to the environment. Moreover, they are also trying to destroy the memories, whereas these people are not inspiring their children to know the value of the precious monuments. A research stated 90% of the parent's influenced their children to stay in a modern home.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, the cost of renovating a building is very cheap because of the advancements in the modern technology. So, the government, who are supporting for this idea, should try to reduce the tax. If a person had tried to implement the renovation, then they are aware of the eco-friendly methods. For instance, to construct a demolishing older home, it costs two times more than the normal budget.",
        "",
        "In the conclusion, a likely reason why most of the people are willing to construct a new building by destroying an ancient construction because they were showing interest in the modern facilities. Though they may not only  cost heavily, they were causing a huge damage to an ecosystem. However, a plenty of memories are being shattered in destroying the area. I believe that it is not good for constructing a building by destroying the previous one."
