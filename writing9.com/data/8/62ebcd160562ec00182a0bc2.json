        "It\u2019s considered that  punishing children at a young age helps to teach them how to distinguish between right and wrong. I agree with this opinion. There must be a way to correct a child\u2019s behaviour and, punishment is applied as an effective means.",
        "First of all, I believe that to gain kids the right habits, they should know there are subsequences for the wrong attitude. If they left without punishing them for his wrong, he might repeat it.  While punishing teach him not to do it again. For  instance, if a little boy took another boy\u2019s foot-bull to keep it and his parent prevent him and also took from him his toys. This will give him the knowledge not to take others\u2019 things. That is why it\u2019s important for early ages to be punished, to gain the right behaviour and subsequences of the wrong one.",
        "The second point, I would like to refer to  the sort of transferring an idea to a child. The way of punishing should be reasonable with the age and the wrong he did. For example, if a  3-4 years child graffiti on a wall you can take the paint from him and let him be in a corner alone for a couple of minutes or when a school kids disturb in the classroom teacher can put him in an isolated area. So, isolation is one of the good means for both ages, Also makes him apologize for his mistakes and prevents him from entertainment. So, the generation breeders should choose whistly how to build the child characters and try to be a good example to follow.",
        "To conclude, it\u2019s a huge responsibility to raise young ages, this require sometimes to use of a hard means but acceptable to transfer their messages to  future youth."
