        "Nowadays, risk-taking is crucial for people, both in their private lives and working lives. In my opinion, I strongly believe that the merits can overshadow the disadvantages for the following reasons.",
        "To begin with, many people argued that giving risky decisions could lead to deleterious consequences. Risk-taking can be harmful because the more you earn, the more you lose. However, I think this is a shortsighted view. To clarify this, understanding too well about our abilities can help us give out risky but optimal choices. For instance, Bill Gates is one of the richest men on Earth who decided to risk his future at Havard and started his own project with Microsoft. Eventually, he became successful and improve his life in personal and career aspects. In a recent speech, Bill Gates pointed out that in order to have today, he had to comprehend deeply his knowledge and truly know what he wanted to invest in. Therefore, it is easy to see the advantages of making risky decisions in career paths and private lives.",
        "On the other hand, I strongly align with the statement that taking risks is also an opportunity to land an adequate job for people in life. To make this clear, chances are something that you will have to seize in order to prove your ability of yourself. One of the best examples of this is Lionel Messi, one of the world's greatest athletes of all time. Messi was given a chance to prove his skills to the world and instantly, he did not miss it and scored a debut goal. Moreover, accepting risk can help people advance their careers as well as obtain practical experience and wisdom. Besides, not only broadens their minds but also helps them learn how to control their emotions to learn and share with our families so that gathering people together. Therefore, it is likely to be more essential to step forward and dare to take a risk in life.",
        "In conclusion, after the aforementioned reasons, it is no doubt that it can be beneficial in making gambling options if we truly understand our abilities which help us in life."
