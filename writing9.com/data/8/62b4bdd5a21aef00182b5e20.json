        "The intent of this letter is to address the increasing parking issues in our association. As we all know, their multiple vehicles in the community where most are two-wheelers which are difficult to park. Moreover, with the parking area provided per flat is relatively smaller to accommodate a car only. Firstly, there is an argument generally noticed among neighbours regarding the two-wheeler parking as after parking the car they are using another parking or the open areas. Here, I would suggest using the MHADA parking as it is in an open area with the semi-covered sheds, for ,this we only need permission from the builder and this will solve our problem to a great extent.",
        "Additionally, I would like to call for a General association meeting at 11:00 am on this Sunday 26th June,22 to look for possible solutions for this issue. Please reply to the meet app association group regarding your availability for a meeting.",
