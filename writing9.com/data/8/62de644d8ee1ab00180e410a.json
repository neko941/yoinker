        "It is pivotal to confess that there are always ups and downs that  occur in life. Some people believe that it is advantageous to admit hardship while others emphasise the significance of mitigating such circumstances and seeking ways to improve. Discussing both views, in my opinion perceiving seeking ways is the most preferable approach to coping with catastrophe.",
        "Calamities present themselves in different forms, will it be in the form of unsatisfactory jobs or a shortage of money. On one hand, people who  simply accept predicaments have a better understanding of their state and become good problem solvers. This is because they accept the reality than rather how they wanted to be. For example, a man deemed to have a shortage of money on regular bases, stressing out too much about it by a great distance makes the situation worse. In addition, this mind sits also provides inner self-happiness, which in turn reduces the chance of committing additional mistakes due to the associated stress. In this way, undue stress that might ensue when we  try to avoid reality is completely avoided. As a result,  this will offer inner peace and abundant energy at disposal to appreciate such conditions without judgement.",
        "On the other hand, others believe that people learn well and become a better version of themselves  if they make some effort to change the adversity they faced with. In other words, if a failure is perceived as a life lesson that can be built on, they analyse the situation and figure out a solution. .  That being so, they recommend tackling the issue and abolishing all the obstacles hindering one from improvement. For example, a man with a shortage of money will work hard to point out hurdles that prevent him from getting a job. This will help him to consider taking pragmatic steps contributing to solving and improving his financial crisis. That is to say, having a positive attitude in unpleasant state mushrooms willpower, perseverance and desire to succeed. Therefore, making humans stronger, well prepared and motivated.",
        "In my opinion, a method consists of an attempt to rectify a drawback that surpasses the acknowledgement of the position and then does nothing about it. To conclude, approval alone is not a solution for the problems in life but rather recognising factors that contribute to the betterment and refining of affairs."
