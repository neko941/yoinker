        "Nowadays art and creativity is a thorny issue for communities. Some people hold the opinion that anyone can create artwork. Others, on the contrary, maintain that only a gifted person could generate something special. Personally, I believe that art and talent could not be measured because it is a complex of personal qualities, appropriate education and hard work.",
        "The main reason why the majority of the populace takes the view that the creation of art does not require special skills is that talent can be acquired through practice. For example, playing piano requires passion and long hours of practice in order to play the music without error. Moreover, everyone has the ability to create art although there is a difference between a good one and a bad one. Undoubtedly, even the famous producers have movies that are less popular than other their blockbusters; however, those films are still masterpieces regardless of the quality.",
        "On the other hand, there is a school of thought that interprets this popularity as a contentious issue. The concern being that a master needs special skills or gifts to be able to create art. For instance, such famous musicians as Mozart or Beethoven achieved their popularity only due to their undeniable talent in music. Furthermore, it is claimed that it is hard to survive in such a competitive sector as art. For instance, someone may be interested in acting, but they cannot become a successful actor because the contest is dramatically high and they cannot get to the audition.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that even though talented people are more likely to achieve recognition, everyone can still be an artist if only they put in enough effort. Therefore, on balance, I believe that the creation of art is not limited to any particular person."
