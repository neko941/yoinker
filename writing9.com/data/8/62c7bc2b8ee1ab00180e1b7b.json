        "I visit this place on a regular basis due to various reasons. I have heard about its history and culture from my friend who is living here since her childhood and she also told me about the place 'Rock Garden'.",

        "Thus, it would be really commendable if you could please reverify the details provided in the article and republish it so that the correct information will reach the potential readers.",
