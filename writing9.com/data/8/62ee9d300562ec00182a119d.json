        "I am writing this letter to inform you about my cabin bag missing which I forgot on the A2233 plane at Vancouver airport on 23rd of July at 9:30am.The plane was quite busy hence, I could not collect my  bag.",
        "As you heard, the bag is a brand new one and it is in red colour. In addition, there is a name tag which is also having my name and address too. This is also having  two support handles which would allow you to pull the bag during the rush place. Furthermore, I also wrote my ticket number on the bag just for identification and I am sure that, this would help us to catch the bag despite multiple bags in one place.",
        "I am more worried as there are some gifts which are mesmerized and expensive as well. Furthermore, it also has my phenomenal academic certificates along with employer reference letters from reputed organisations. Last but not the least, I also kept my home keys inside the bag which is more terrifying.",
        "I look forward to hearing a quick update with good news regarding my cabin bag.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Lakshmi."
