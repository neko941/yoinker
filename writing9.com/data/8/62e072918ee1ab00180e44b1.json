        "My name is Rishi Jayakumar and my student ID is 528901. I am taking your economics course, section b. As I am an MBA student, there was another course where the professor had a kept last minute exam, which caused me to be unable to focus on the project. My grades in the course were already low, so I had to do really well in the exam.",
        "Please accept my apology for putting you in this spot, and no disgrace to your course, professor. It was just the situation where I had to focus on the exam and had no other option. I hope you could grant me an extension for just two days and I will submit the project before the end of the day.",
