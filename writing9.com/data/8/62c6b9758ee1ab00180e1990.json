Others think that true function of the university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless whether the course is useful to an employer.\nWhat, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university?",

        "It is widely believed that universities are responsible to give knowledge and skills obligated for future jobs. However, there is another group of people who consider that higher education's purpose is giving knowledge needed for students but not for employers. To my mind, universities are supposed to do both: provide appropriate soft skills and teach paramount classes for a workplace. In this essay, I will elaborate on what should be included in a higher education program.",
        "To start with, nowadays the concept of well-developed soft skills is widespread. Critical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making are a must-have for the workplace and modern society. Also, some scientific experiments demonstrate that people with mentioned soft skills in CV are more likely to get a job, moreover, these people get their promotion two times faster. Therefore, universities which provide soft skills classes in their program are higher on the list of universities ranking.",
        "However, soft skills are not the only clue to a successful workplace. Knowledge in the working area is vital, looking for a job without job qualifications is futile activity, even intern positions require some fundamental knowledge. For instance, future coders without knowing programming languages but having only soft skills can not find an appropriate workplace. That is why universities are supposed to provide classes with a basis for every profession.",
        "To conclude, soft skills and knowledge complement each other in successful working life. Professional knowledge and well-developed soft skills are the clues to success. So, it is paramount to master all the requirements."
