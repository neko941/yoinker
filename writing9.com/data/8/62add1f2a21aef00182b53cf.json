        "In present-day society, there has been much discussion about the construction of cities. Some people believe that beautiful buildings and construction will attract more people while others think that the city should be built based on public needs. In this essay, I will discuss both views and state my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, many argue that a good-looking city will boost the town's economy owing to the fact that it could attract more tourists, unlike cities that are not decorated. For example, Paris is known for its beautiful, classic construction and unique architecture. This unrivalled scenery makes the city become a tourist hotspot that people need to visit once in their lifetime. This is why the city\u2019s tourism can improve the local economy. / This is evidence that the local economy can be improved by tourism.",
        "On the other hand, other individuals believe that the service is the most important aspect of a city\u2019s development. A city should have basic infrastructures such as educational institutions, health facilities and good transportation. Consequently, this will improve residents\u2019 living standards. For instance, Singapore is one of the best cities due to its well-planned facilities to sustain life. Because of this, it became the centre for businesses and companies to run efficiently and boost the economy. Furthermore, once the city\u2019s functionality has been developed,  the place can be re-created to attract tourists, after the funding for additional improvement is sufficient.",
        "In conclusion, although attractive cities can boost economic growth, I think that cities that are designed to serve the needs of residents as priorities. After having all well-functioning facilities, they can be re-designed to be a place to attract tourists. What matters most is the good welfare and supporting facilities for people who live in the city."
