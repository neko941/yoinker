        "The potential for the global media to shape the views of the today's youth is considerable. However, while some commentators think that the media has no place within secondary education, other analysts defend the idea that international news should be studied at school. In this essay, I shall examine a number of studies which show that both the view points, to some degree,  are justified.",
        "To begin with, the global media undoubtedly enriches teenager's understanding of contemporary affairs. This is because television reports provide a concise summary of international affairs. For example, a study showed that the media heavily influenced teenager's knowledge of contemporary affairs. Since any secondary school education is incomplete without an awareness of such events, it is therefore clear that media can play a vital role in assisting education.",
        "On the other hand, many critics argue that teenagers are negatively affected by the global media's focus on war and civil unrest. This is because exposure to violence often leads to depression. For example, recent surveys have discovered that depressed teenagers usually cite the dismal state of the world as a source for their depression. Since, mental health is an important objective of secondary education, it is therefore questionable whether the study of international news wouldn't be a destructive and wasteful use of school resource.",
        "In conclusion, it should be clear that there are reasons for and against the study of news at school. Thus if media studies are to enter the school in the future, schools will have to think about how the negative aspects of the news can be decreased, and positive aspects maximized."
