        "A group of people think that fitness centre or gym helps them maintain body while other individuals opine that daily exercise is enough to keep a healthy body. I consider that routine activity such as walking, yoga is enough to stay fit.",
        "On the one hand, Daily exercises are more effective in many ways. Firstly, regular health workout such as jogging, running and yoga are natural, no specific time and money required for this since people can do as part of their daily routine. Besides, these activities help to regulate blood pressure, lower cholesterol and reduce the chance of heart disease. For example, all countries now celebrate International yoga day because it helps millions of people worldwide to fight against diseases such as cancer and heart attack.",
        "On the other hand, some people believe that gym or health clubs are flexible for doing a workout because nowadays all health centre provides a huge variety of equipment as well as it has a trainer for guidance. For instance, there are many training drills in the gym such as pull-down, deadlift, bench press, treadmill and many more. These physical activities not only increase the strength of muscles in a body but also develop it. Thus, joining a gym is necessary to keep the body fit.",
        "In conclusion, although few people think that joining a gym is the best option to stay healthy, others consider that routine exercise at home is essential in order to tackle dangerous diseases. Therefore, I deem that natural exercise is actually imperative to maintain fitness and health in future."
