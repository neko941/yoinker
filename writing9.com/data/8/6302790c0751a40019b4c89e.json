        "I've written this letter to express my dissatisfaction last night with your cuisine restaurant. After we passed our annual audit, we try to visit your venue because many of my neighbours have said  that your crew is hospitable and served tasty food. We are greatly disappointed in the bad cooking and behaviour of the faculty.",
        "After our night shift duty, we visit your food shop in order to celebrate our victory in an annual audit. When we arrived, there are only  small tables available for our groups, we tried to call the attention of your staff, but they failed to attend immediately because most of your staff are on  break. We waited  patiently for a long time and some of my friends complained already of their empty stomachs.",
        "When the food is served, it is uncooked and with a bad smell, we tried to ask for a new one, but the staff ask for additional money. We just ate the pasta, but it is not in good taste also. We complained but the guard threatened to kick us out of the area. We pay the whole meal  but did not finish our orders due to bad food and services.",
        "I would like to suggest that you must train your staff to have good behaviour at the workplace and serve tasty food for customers to enjoy.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
