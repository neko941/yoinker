        "Dear Mr Brown,",
        "I am writing this letter to make a request regarding setting up a new cafe for employees in the office. Let me explain to you about the problems that are faced by our respective staff. Firstly, our office does not has any separate place to eat. Therefore, some staff do not have lunch which results in health illness as they undergo starving for a long time. Secondly, due to busy work schedules, the employees do not have time to eat which indirectly leads to less energy and consequently less productivity at work.",
        "As far as my feelings are concerned, to work continuously for 8 hours every day, an individual needs a break and should eat something to regain the lost energy during work. In order to do that, there should be a pantry section in our office, where the employees can have their lunch for a definite time period. I am sure other staff would feel the same.",
        "I would like to suggest that our old record room which is vacant for a year, could be converted into an eating section for a temporary period; it would take some time to build a new cafeteria. Being for the time, staff would be ready to adjust in the old record room.",
        "Looking forward to positive action from your side.",
        "Your's sincerely,",
