        "If asked whether choosing a job early and having a stable career or switching jobs frequently that experience more fulfilment, many would struggle to make the final choice. In my opinion, while job hopping has its own benefits, choosing a job earlier on and keeping it would provide people with a greater sense of fulfilment.",
        "On the one hand, there are several merits to job hopping. Firstly, people who switch from one job to another are likely to have more chances to try their hands at different fields, hence acquiring a lot of skills and becoming multifunctional, all-purpose people. In fact, with various experiences learnt from previous employment, they can put the knowledge into practice at their new workplace and thus job hoppers would find more job satisfaction and receive recognition for their capabilities. Secondly, by changing jobs frequently, people may have a shot at various working environments to find what job is suitable for their personalities, so that they can stay in that job for a long period of time. For example, many youngsters nowadays would rather explore a range of different occupations than have a stable job in order to seek more dynamic opportunities that could later prove more fulfilment.",
        "On the other hand, there are numerous strong reasons why holding down the same job and pursuing it in the long term appeals to many people. People staying in a job in the long term would benefit from better job prospects such as promotion opportunities and pay rises. As a matter of fact, when workers are responsible for the same tasks, they gradually gain more experience and sharpen their skills at work. This helps them to be increasingly competent over the years. For example, people who pursue a constant career can learn from their mistakes, enhance productivity and move up the career ladder. Besides, people may get various perks namely sick leave, holiday entitlement, a generous retirement package or yearly bonuses. In addition to improving job prospects, those who stay in the same job may establish a wide and steady network of partners, which is crucial for gaining support from long-term colleagues to have productive work and life.",
        "In conclusion, switching jobs usually have its own benefits, I also totally agree with the idea that staying with the same job and pursuing it will be more likely to bring better job fulfilment."
