        "I am an employee at your company in Oman branch. I would like to request  an internal transfer to the head office in Dubai for six months.",
        "I joined your organisation  four years as store staff and I want to upgrade my qualification to support work at the store. Thus, I want to enrol in Supply Chain training in Dubai which will starts in June and finish in December and I believe attending work from the head office will allow me to work and learn at the same time.",
        "Workwise, I am planning to hand over my physical tasks to my colleague at our office and follow up closely with him. I will arrange weekly online meetings to acknowledge the updates and solve some possible problems that might appear. Finally, I would personally upload the monthly report to the section head.",
        "Would you kindly help me with the arrangements for the transfer process and acceptance from the head office. It is faster when the manager informs the office directly and provides a non-objection letter with the application.",
        "Your help is highly appreciated.",
