        "Its speculated that more people will rather go for a vacation in one\u2019s own country rather than a foreign nation. This essay agrees with the aforesaid statement that people will prefer to go on holiday within their homeland in the future. Preventing the loss of revenue and being able to appreciate the beauty of our own nation are some of the reasons behind it.",
        "When we travel outside, we are paying a lot for our travel, hotel, cab fare and sightseeing, all the money from which is going to a foreign land. Instead, if we choose to holiday within our own homeland, this money stays with our government. Furthermore, this will enable and encourage the government to build more attractions and preserve the existing ones if there are more people visiting them. For example, the Lotus Temple in New Delhi which has been beautified even further and made more accessible to people.",
        "There are a lot of interesting places within one's native land which one can explore while on vacation. Everyone should take out the time to visit these places and appreciate these first rather than marvelling at attractions from another country. For instance, the beaches in Andaman and Nicobar Islands which are no less in comparison than any other International beach.",
        "In conclusion, there is a thought that most people will prefer going on a vacation in their own homeland and avoid travelling abroad on a holiday. I completely agree with the aforesaid statement as we should explore our country to appreciate its beauty first while also preventing loss of revenue."
