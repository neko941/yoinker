        "Education is a key factor in our life. Moreover, parents have various opinions about school subject matters that which ones assist to child6 in their future. Although some of them declare history subject is the most essential one , others believe science and technology are the best. As long  this happens traditionally in the school environment and this essay will focus these both views and eventually I will give  my opinion too.",
        "To begin with, students who are willing to do history courses in college time, think it helps them to learn ancient databases without ancestors is the most valuable way. Even if they try to become a patriotic person  in a real activity they are not able to live in an earlier manner.  For example, when children attempt to learn past  because they hope to become  patriotic or want to do good things for  the country. Consequently, it never helps  theories personal life, as long as  they acquire only the great past of a  nation.",
        "On the other hand, presently,  technological courses are  becoming  popular in the school environment. While humankind mostly gives  priority to subjects which are useful for their future carrier. Particularly, computer-based science has the biggest demand and pupil strives to achieve their goals  through this. For instance, an Indian survey shows, that 80% of learners had obtained technological streams for their higher studies.  As a result, they have a opportunity to get high salaries in future whereas they would be able to make their life easier in  modern society.",
        "In conclusion, I believe in this era past would not assist to live in the present time and it only paves the way to acquiring subject matters. Although technical subjects have  great access to get  jobs ,  qualifications and reputation  among the communities. If we have the capability to do computer-based theories enable us to get a fortune  for a better tomorrow one day."
