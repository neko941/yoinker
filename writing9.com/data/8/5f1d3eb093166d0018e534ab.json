        "One school of thought believes that the child ought to be admitted into an institution at toddler age of life, whilst most of the people want a youngster to enjoy playing at the beginning stage. However I strongly agree with an earlier part that prefers the offspring to proceed towards education, having real time to learn the skills along with social exposure.",
        "To begin with, the early studies support a schoolboy to gain skills effectively. This is because a child at a current stage is sensitive to catch whatever the teachings are provided. Similarly if a candidate has an exposure of any subject in school, he is likely to study precisely and become successful. Furthermore, this period of studies is essential to form a basis of any academic course. Hence, the young age helps a pupil to learn an education concisely.",
        "In addition, the aspects of early schooling of a child give them social exposure in an institution. On one side a youngster has communications and meeting with the unknown colleagues or classmates, with whom he exchanges his thoughts. Taking my personal example, I had begun primary studies at an age of 2.5 years and had mingled with new classmate; thus, we had been sharing our ideas with each others.  Moreover, a pupil is encouraged to attend events such as independent day of a country, where he meets with new people, and gain knowledge about these types of occasions and participation. Consequently, the community influence helps a schoolboy to grow and gain awareness about the society.",
        "In conclusion, the prematurely studies build a base for an education and provides a practical view of the environment. I believe those adolescents are sensitive to get encouraged towards every new stuff that they see practically; therefore that time must be utilized in studies"
