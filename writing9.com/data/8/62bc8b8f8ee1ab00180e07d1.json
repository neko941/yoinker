        "Learning a second language is essential for academic and professional purposes. Historically, foreign languages have been taught in secondary school. However, some specialists advocate that it would be more beneficial if pupils learned them from an earlier age. Some schools have already adopted this policy, which has positive and negative aspects.",
        "Opponents of this policy argue that young offspring are already exposed to a considerable number of traditional courses such as science, math, history etc. By adding more classes at a young age, children would have limited time to participate in other activities, such as arts or sports, essential for healthy development. Furthermore, primary school teachers are usually generalists, as they do not have the necessary skills themselves, schools will need to hire specialists. This could be expensive and only institutions with a more generous budget would be able to implement these programs.",
        "Although the above arguments are valid, I do not believe they outweigh the advantages. The obvious argument in its favour is that young kids pick up speech much easier than adolescents. Not only are their brains still being shaped and programmed to learn their mother tongue, but they are also not inhibited by self-consciousness. Furthermore, in learning a second language, pupils would be exposed to different cultures, which could help them to understand and embrace diversity. There are different actions that could be put in place to tackle the concerns raised by those who are against this policy. For instance, pupils could learn the second language in short sessions and in a ludic-centred approach. Moreover, governments could destinate specific funding for either capacitating primary school teachers or hiring professionals with the necessary  skills.",
        "In conclusion, the benefits of learning a second language at a younger age are numerous, and under no circumstances should funding constraints or preconceptions beliefs hamper its implementation"
