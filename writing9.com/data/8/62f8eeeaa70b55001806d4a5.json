        "Dear Mr Black,",
        "I am Zay Yar Myint, the leasee of your room at Artemis condo on On Nut road, Bangkok. I am writing this letter to inform you about some deteriorated conditions of furniture.",
        "Firstly, I would like to highlight the condition of the couch in the living room. Since the time we moved in, I found a small scratch at a corner and I even showed it to the agent lady. Since then, the scratch on stitches enlarged continuously and now we can even see the cushion foams through it.",
        "Despite my bad feelings to point out defects in each item in the room, I have to complain about a chair at the dining table which had only two screws on its frame. Fortunately, I found it out before it makes any incident to any of my family members. It surprised me when I saw it and I urgently fixed it myself.",
        "Although I don't usually complain a lot about the conditions of appliances and furniture in rental rooms, according to the serious situation of the couch, I need to inform you about it and must request to change to a new sofa that would be suitable for my one-year-old daughter. As I mentioned earlier, you do not need to do anything with the chair.",
        "I hope you would understand the situation and look forward to your prompt action on my request.",
        "Yours sincerely,",
        "Zay Yar Myint."
