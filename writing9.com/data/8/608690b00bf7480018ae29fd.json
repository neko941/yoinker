        "Nowadays, there are different government systems that country per country decide what is the best education for their students. In fact, some countries force their scholar to specialize them in a limited range of subjects, especially from the age of fifteen, to prepare their youngster for a \"world of the job\". On the contrary, some nations prefer another type of education: they require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of both views, and finally, I would state my own opinion regarding the matter.",
        "On the one hand, public authorities want to teach their scholars the main subjects and sectors they need to learn to increase their possibility of work. In fact, government nations, usually invest in this type of school system to specialize their undergraduates and it represents a strategy to fight against unemployment. For example, in China's countryside, the unemployment rates declined significantly, and it is an enormous benefit that started from their school methods.",
        "On the other hand, ministers that prefer to educate students to study some subjects obtained benefits. In fact, it is known that if undergraduates could learn some subjects in their high school experience, it could enhance their minds and mentality. Thus, they also could go up to their cultural knowledge. Moreover, another important advantage is that they could passionate about one of these subjects.",
        "To conclude, every education systems have their key power, but I personally think that it is important that every individual should know many aspects of our world because it could improve their personality and above all their culture for their future."
