        "Few people who are not academically sound could still be victorious in life. This could definitely be possible because success entails consistent efforts and hard work. Also, interest is another significant factor that has a positive impact on whatever chosen career in life. In this essay, I will discuss extensively reasons why some individuals still excel despite being a failure in school.",
        "Firstly, the most crucial quality to excel in any endeavour is consistency. Practice brings about perfection. Therefore, youth could possibly achieve their desired goals through consistent efforts and hard work which pays off at the end of the day. As a matter of fact, an illiterate could be more successful than an educated fellow if these two aforementioned qualities are put into practice. Academics  could be part of success but not a determinant as few wealthy people in my country have not even seen the four walls of classrooms. For instance, I used to have a classmate in high school who usually take the last position, however, he is presently a successful businessman and an employer of labour. Hence, failure in school is not a predominant trait for success in life, rather concerted efforts and diligence are rather crucial to succeed in life.",
        "Moreover, parents have a huge impact on the performance of their wards in school. Honestly, most parents forced their children to study a particular course in school and this led to woeful performances. If many children are motivated to pursue their dream course, it would definitely contribute to their success as they already have a passion for it. For instance, my niece wanted to be an accountant but her father insisted she must study medicine. This actually delayed her in school and funds were wasted as she failed numerous times and even went under probation. She later went to accounting and there was a huge difference in her performance. She is now a renowned financial adviser in a big company. Therefore, interest and passion are important factors to be considered in choosing any career.",
        "In conclusion, the rate of failure in school is now prominent because many parents failed to realize the significance of passion. Once the interest is there, the student work assiduously to accomplish their dream and the rate of success in their career would increase rapidly."
