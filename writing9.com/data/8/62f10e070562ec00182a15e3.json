        "Nowadays, many companies assume that paying attention to innovations of the products provides a lot of benefits to sales management. In my opinion, I totally disagree with this statement. However,this perspective causes two main negative effects on the environment and clients.",
        "To begin with, marketing strategies which have been prioritizing newness for a long time caused many kinds of environmental defects in nature. People who allow buying unnecessary products have already gotten caught in an increasing  consumerism culture. Moreover, this gap has been used by companies with this awareness. For example, many high-tech companies reproduce their products which have been existing in the marketplace with a few differences. Despite knowing this, they market it  with a new commercial. Nevertheless, if many people did not continue with  this view, we would not have  environmental issues. On the other hand , these products consist of  heavy minerals and they do not dissolve in the soil.",
        "Secondly, many people believe that they are exploited by huge companies for  making more profit with a new product advertisement. This understanding cause trust issues for their loyal clients. Although this advertising method is preferred by large companies, this perspective has emerged a long-term loss of lucrativeness.For instance, some people who follow technology news constantly have noticed that this product does not have any kind of improvements before the last product. After this attitude of the company, many clients will stop buying this company's products. If we want sustainable product policies, we should give up feeding this perspective.",
        "In conclusion, many companies give importance to short-term gains. In spite of this understanding, we should choose prudential solutions for the advertisement policies and company cultures. We can be more responsible for the environment and the trust of clients."
