        "As you may be aware I am doing a master's in Project Management, and it is going to finish in next month. So these days, I am busy  finalizing my research document which I need to submit  on the 24th of September. Just after finishing the research, we have to sit for the final exams. Therefore, it would be really helpful if I can have some day off from my regular duties focused on the exam.",
        "Being a project manager for the last ten years, I felt the real value of doing this course as suggested to me during last year's performance evaluation. Actually now I realize how you became so successful in handling the projects with a neat timeline as well as achieving good results . I hope I would do the same since I have been assigned to lead the  next project that we are hoping to do with the Indian company.",
        "I would appreciate your immediate attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you.",
