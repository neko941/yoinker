In addition, we also noticed that we do not have substantial ventilation during the daytime as well. Furthermore, there are some animals which are playing inside  the library building and not sure how our public will spend time in the building.",

Hence,  I would request you to please do help me to pass on this message to our local communities as they can also understand and come up with any action plan to secure our building without any further delay.",
