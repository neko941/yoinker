        "There is saying that we should respect our elders and pay attention to their golden words as they went through a lot of pains and hazards in their life because of which their experience would be great guide to us.  So, some cultures think old people should be valued high whereas other cultures values young ones more than the elderly people.  This essay illustrates both the view.",
        "To begin with, Youngsters having a fresh mind often comes up with different innovative ideas which lead to the betterment of  society.  With the help of the technology, they are able to build user-friendly applications that will connect the entire world through which instant up-gradation of happenings is possible. Mr Mark Zuckerberg for instance  found and developed the Facebook app during his college time in order to connect all his friends but it is a vast connecting platform for a decade now.  At the time of jallikkattu protest in the southern part of India, Facebook had given live updates at once.  He has become an inspiration to many young pals today as he is quite successful in his family life too besides the busy schedule of his venture.   Therefore, he is valued more than any other old-aged people do.",
        "On the other hand, Old persons are having great instinct mind, steadiness towards a matter and acts on it. Taking into account the previous consequences and knowledge and experience  in their field, an elder person takes a decision based on his own instinct to handle the critical situation at a higher level.  For example, a judge in a court  thoroughly inquires a case in the following ways,  patiently listens to the arguments, gives time to offenders to explain his part, seeks for public opinions, etc. Followed by that he analyses the discussions and comes up with a conclusion.  It shows his steady and descriptive mind which everyone needs.  Starting from Prime Ministers, Presidents, Judges, successful businessman and surgeon doctors are almost elders leading or governing a country.  They possess high values and gives chance to youngsters to bring social wellness.",
        "In my opinion, elders, of course, should be given due respect, as well as youngsters, should be encouraged by them to grow like them in future.",
        "To conclude, as far as concern, everyone either old or young should be given respect for their talents and works."
