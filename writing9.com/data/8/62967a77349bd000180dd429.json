        "The architecture of a locality conveys ample about the people living there and the culture. Considering this, in many places the communities insist on having a similar architectural facade whereas many other people disregard this and prefer building homes in their own styles. It is important to admit that both views have their own merits. In this essay, I will discuss the possible reasons that support each view, and the benefits they bring to  society.",
        "On the one hand, it is significant to consider that a traditional outlook for all the homes gives a sense of symmetry to the neighbourhood. For an outsider visiting the place, this style gives an aesthetic appeal of culture and grandeur. For example, on any visit to cities like Jaipur and Lucknow, one can sense the tradition of the royalty, as the construction of building in these places reflect the palatial Mewadi and Nawabi lifestyles, respectively. Furthermore, many people argue that a similar structure is a boon in case of an emergency such as a fire outbreak. In other words, having a similar design facilitates rescue operations during contingencies.",
        "On the other hand, every person has individuality, and it also is reflected in the way they design and decorate their homes. In modern times, it is common to find houses that are designed in contemporary styles, which gives them a modern outlook. In such residences, the owner selects patterns that he or she has an affinity for, thus, giving an independent outlook to the viewer. Moreover, home during the present times needs to be cost-efficient in all manners. the contemporary methods of construction give an array of choices to create modern energy-efficient homes. For example, my neighbours have reconstructed their villa, by adding equipment such as solar panels and also included a terrace garden with a patio. The rooms have glass windows to allow light to enter the house and the roof is made up of material to keep it cool during the summers.",
        "To conclude, owning a house is a dream opportunity, therefore, individuals should be allowed to construct it at their will. However, in the heritage ,centres the government can take measures to retain the cultural outlook of the place."
