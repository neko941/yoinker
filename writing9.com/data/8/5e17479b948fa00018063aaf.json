        "It has been witnessed that people have been increasingly using social website and applications over the last 10 years. Although this inclination has equally positives and negatives, I believe it is up to the user how should he use such platforms without becoming habitual.",
        "Beginning with the benefits, social websites have made it possible to make new relations without wasting human effort. By using the websites, such as Facebook, they can not only contact with their near and dear ones, but also meet new people of similar interests regardless of their distance. On the top of that, they can make video calls via Facebook which has enabled people to talk to each other, as if the conversation is going on between real people though they might be at a distance of a thousand miles. However, if they have to hang out in person, it could be expensive, and the time-consuming activity.  Moreover, social media application has given a platform for people to interact with their idols. Celebrities from all sections such as politics, cinema and sports are more likely to interact with their fans. As a result, social media sites have been used by celebs to remain popular by updating their latest events. At the same time, fans remain motivated by interacting with renowned personalities. Amitabh Bachchan, for instance, is a regular tweeter user.",
        "Moving towards disadvantages, overindulgence on social media applications can be detrimental for health. A recent report by health magazine states that the majority of people like to spend 6-8 hours on their social accounts. It could lead to various physical disorders such as eye problems like myopia and posture problems like cervical. At the same time, it reduces their productivity in their schools and workplaces. Further, another bad effect could be on children because there is no restriction on posting inappropriate or vulgar contents. As teenagers significant portion of the total social website uses, they become easy prey of such contents that could lead to various psychological ailments such as depression and anxiety. Nonetheless, if they were parental central restriction, they could be saved from the ill-effects of social websites.",
        "In conclusion, increasing the use of social websites has bought various positives and negatives, it seems to me that technology is always biased. Therefore, we should control ourselves from becoming over-pendent on it."
