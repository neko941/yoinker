        "I am writing this letter to complain about my Samsung mobile phone which I  purchased from your store last week. It is one of the latest models and has a high-resolution camera. Unfortunately, when I tried to capture some photographs at home, resulted in low-quality images. Moreover, when I tried to listen music, the sound of music was also very low.",
        "I tried all the manual instructions, even I also talked to one of your support people on my cell phone. Neither the manual instruction nor his advice improves the quality of the pictures and sound. Therefore, I want you to either  replace this mobile with a new one or refund my money. I hope you will understand this matter and take action quickly to solve this issue.",
        "Kindly inform me which condition is agreed for you. I look forward to hearing from you.",
