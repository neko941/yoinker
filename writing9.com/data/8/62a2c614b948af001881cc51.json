        "Dear ABC Shop Manager,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction with my shopping experience which I did at the Vancouver central park store on the 10th of January. I have bought a brand new blender from your store but when I unpacked it at my home I was really not happy with the way it does work  also I have noticed a few dents on the product and I feel like holding a used one.",
        "Right after this situation, I had given a call to the store as I was not happy with the product damage and functionality but despite multiple phone calls none of them answered  finally today morning one of the executives attempted my call with very rude behaviour along with cross-talking to my request which is not at  acceptable.",
        "As you hear my bad experience and concern and I want you to take the necessary actions to make my next visit happy. Such as providing some quality training along with some quick audits on how they are talking and approaching customers .",
        "I look forward to hearing your response to my complaint and I hope It will help me to have the best experience.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
