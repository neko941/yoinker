        "During these parties, she invites many friends from out of the hostel who is not permitted to enter as per hostel rules and regulations. Firstly, I thought it will be ended in a couple of days but she organized the parties each alternate day. Furthermore, she invites her outside friends who speak a very bad language, and also plays music at a high sound, Hence it affects my studies and sleeping time too.",
