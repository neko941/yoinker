        "Some people believe that it is vital for everyone to have access to different information such as scientific research, business, and the academic world. However, some people believe that we must have limitations for sharing some information. In this essay, I will discuss both these views.",
        "On the one hand, having data easily will help people to increase knowledge and advance in a variety of fields. Some free data can make it easier for people to become aware of other aspects of their lives, such as medicine or technology. For example, some scientists are glad to share information with other people or other scientists because they think that it is beneficial for the replication of analyses and the overall advancement of science. Moreover, in the outbreak of Covid - 19, it is crucial to report the disease and inform all people about the consequences that they will be faced.",
        "On the other hand, certain types of information in the wrong hands can be devastating for society. There are many professionals whose jobs are to produce research and new concepts. When they are not paid for this work, they can no longer generate science. In addition, some of this research deals with dangerous fields such as nuclear physics and pharmaceuticals. For instance, last year an act of terror occurred because some criminals were able to learn how to make explosives using free information on the internet. This clearly should not be permissible, and for this reason alone, not all information should be free to access for everyone.",
        "In conclusion, distributing free information can help in certain aspects but can also have some disadvantages for society. I strongly believe that people should not give much data because of its drawbacks."
