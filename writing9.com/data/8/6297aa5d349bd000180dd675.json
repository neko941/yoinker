        "Based on the development of technology in the contemporary era, incredible flexibility has been bestowed to some occupations to be done from distance and be sent to companies via the internet,which is called telecommunication.In my point of view,it is interwoven with numerous advantages that are uttered in this essay.",
        "One of the most highlighted benefits has to do with the efficiency that has emerged in the results of workings.To enlighten,while used to the hours of vocational activities were considered to evaluate employees qualifications nowadays,the consequences of their activities are of  higher importance, as it is infeasible for administers to monitor their staffs' working period.To illustrate,for further promotions,individuals will do better jobs.",
        "In addition, faster flourishing streams will be experienced in divergent sections in societies while citizens have the capability to choose their favourite circumferences in order to focus on their responsibilities.To illustrate,neither interrupting noises nor their colleagues exist to distort the line of their thoughts,while their cellphones as well can be silent if they do not want to be distracted.As a vivid case,libraries are kept in a quiet situation to enhance pupils' concentration on their lessons.",
        "On the other hand,multitudes of the problems that humans encounter today will be eradicated automatically.For instance,not only global warming but the rate of fossil fuel consumption will also plummet drastically if city_dwellers do their duties from home without unnecessary commuting to their offices.Due to release new,using vehicles for transporting is the main reason behind mentioned setbacks.For example,during the spread of Covid19,the rate of air pollution has dived sharply while folks were locked down.",
        "To conclude,different positive footprints are bestowed to the earth by dominated usage of the internet and its capacities as a piece amenity to work from home.To explain, the time saved from escaping congested traffic could be exploited for vocational or personal targets that to me,ultimately ends up in worthful prosperities."
