        "There has been a controversy about whether a person's choice of clothes can tell a lot about his culture and character. I agree with this idea, and my reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs.",
        "First, clothes are a manifestation of culture. As we know, due to the difference in geography, habits, aesthetic views and other different reasons, each costume has its unique style and character. Take suits as an example. The concept of stereoscopic thinking influences westerners largely; therefore, the clothes they design are replete with this idea. For example, the tailcoat has an exquisite design, which fully expresses the idea of stereoscopic thinking.",
        "Second, clothes can reflect the wearer's inner activities and characters. It has been reported that the costume a person wears is affected by social and psychological factors. The costume acts as a sign to convey the wearer's occupation, hobbies and personality. Take me as an example. All my clothes are quite unpretentious; I never wear something that is flashy, such as in yellow or green colour. At this point, my characteristics can be shown roughly by observing the clothes I wear.",
        "On the other hand, the costume a person wears can be misleading sometimes. Take Supreme as an example. It's a famous skateboard brand and a fashion brand. The reason why most people wear it is just that it's trendy; it doesn't mean every Supreme wear understands and loves skateboard culture. In this case, most of us wear clothes just for fashion reasons, not everyone wants to express his unique characteristics through his costume.",
        "In conclusion, clothes are a good way to tell a lot about a person's culture and character; nevertheless, they can be misleading as well."
