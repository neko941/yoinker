        "The invention of the television has been one of the most significant breakthroughs in the entertainment as well as the educational fields in the recent past. That is why it is considered that youngsters should be given an inspiration to watch it on a regular basis rather than at school or home. As far as I am concerned, I partly agree with that point of view.",
        "On the one hand, TV channels transmit a lot of fine quality programmes, by way of illustration, BBC has a car show named \"Top Gear\" which is not only used for sharing news of the automobile world, but also for illustrating vivid places far and wide along with evaluating an enormous number of vehicles individually. As a matter of fact, such shows may disclose a hidden passion of each child for a particular activity. For example, there is a significant trend that the vast majority of today's animal photographers were crazy for watching  documental films about flora and fauna on channels like National Geographic.",
        "On the other hand, in this day and age, the promotions together with the serials targeted at the adolescent community do not play the central role in popularizing science. What is more, children may turn to addicts without entirely understanding the consequences of such a distractive habit. As a result, this tendency may produce unexpected subsequences for both parents along with their offspring, like a lack of concentration and productivity.",
        "Taking everything into consideration, to my mind parents should take  responsibility and begin to sort the content that their kids consume in order to prevent horrid consequences."
