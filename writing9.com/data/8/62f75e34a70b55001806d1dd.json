        "Dear Sir,",
        "I hope you are doing well. I am Alice, and I have organised a meeting with my colleagues in your hotel  last Wednesday. I am sorry to let you know that we all are disappointed regarding the lunch we received that day.",
        "Firstly, We all liked your office decor and especially, the video conferencing room. The sound system and the cameras you installed were fantastic. We were able to do our meeting successfully because of this special room. Secondly, we had  lunch in the cafeteria where the buffet was being served. Apparently, when we had our first bite we all  noticed that the food was not warm. So, all the taste of the items, your kitchen team has prepared has already gone. It was an extremely bad moment for me, because i was the only one who arranged everything for my colleagues.",
        "So, I want to give you some advice that your waiters and other team members should keep a check while serving food whether it is hot or not. Another thing, you should have electronic hot cases to keep food warm. This way you'll not lose your customers.",
        "I hope you'll take it on a positive note",
