        "Although some companies endorse sports as a method of promoting their business. Some people are of the opinion that it is advantageous while others believe that there are problems associated with this. I consider that companies supporting sports, is a good way of gaining publicity.",
        "On the one hand, patronizing sports ensures popularity and more patronage in business and I agree. Many companies today are recognized because they sponsor numerous sports. To illustrate, today, Puma and Adidas have taken over numerous sports- outfit companies because of their devoted support for so many football teams all over the world. Therefore, businesses that sponsor sports are widely known and patronized. Secondly, companies gain a high level of trust from the masses when they sponsor sports. A popular energy drink which has been in existence since the 80\u2019s became relevant to me when I saw Usian Bolt a marathon race champion advertise for them. Thus, giving me an assurance in the quality of their product.",
        "On the other hand, the problem associated with using sports to communicate about a product to people is that such adverts require huge amount  money. It is only a financially balanced company that can embark on such endorsements. To clarify, Pepsi endorses only world\u2019 best footballers for their advertisements, which would definitely cost them a fortune. As a result, such companies will be spending so much in promoting their business.",
        "In conclusion, while people vary in their opinion, I think companies stand a better chance to succeed when they support sports companies as a means of publicizing themselves. Although they tend to spend so much by choosing such method of publicity."
