        "I am writing this letter on the behalf of Amrapali society, to draw your immediate attention that a road is being built through the local park area which will highly impact the social life of the local public.",
        "Firstly, Godstone park only parks in the nearby locality with all high-rise buildings and the only source of fresh air and a play area for children. Building a road through it will impact pollution and also endanger  children hit by vehicles.Consequently , youngsters will stop going to parks and this will impact their physical and mental health.",
        "On the other hand, elderly people are also using this park for regular morning , and evening walks and also it is used for yoga classes . Due to this , the road all  social activities will get hampered . Furthermore , It will also raise noise pollution which will impact young children in concentration and will further impact their studies.",
        "I would request , Kindly reconsider this proposal and or move this construction to a different area.",
        "Waiting for your favourable response.",
        "Yours Faithfully,",
