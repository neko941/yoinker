        "I am writing to you to express some concerns regarding my recent visit to one of your stores located near the Sherbrook metro station. My intention was to pick out a new laptop but everything went awry.",
        "First, I was having a hard time looking for a consultant, seems like everybody disappeared. After several attempts at capturing someone's attention I finally managed to find a worked. As far as I remember, his name was Jack. I asked him to help me choose a laptop of a particular configuration and he recommended  a few models.",
        "I was so delighted that there was exactly what I needed, that is why I did not double-check the computer, paid for it and left the shop. But when I got home, I found out that the processor in my laptop was a completely different one. I understand that it was partially my mistake, I should have checked it before paying. On the flip side, I clearly described my requirements to Jack and he did a poor job helping me. I had to spend some extra time returning the machine. I would be grateful if you speak with your employee and  explain him how it is important to be focused while working with the customers.",
