        "Dear Sir or Madam,",
        "I am writing this letter regarding my recent lost watch on my holiday trip to Phu Quoc Island. I would like you to cover the cost of this item.",
        "This watch belonged to my daughter, which I had just bought for her on the occasion of her previous month's graduation. It has a rose gold colour all over with a thick leather strap detailing.  I also specially requested one of the electronic store technicians to craft the signature of my daughter in blue diamond to show off my love for her. It cost me a total of $3000. I hereby enclose with this letter a photo of the watch as well as its receipt for your reference.",
        "The incident happened so fast that I felt in shock after realizing the wristwatch was gone. There was a group of five young boys surrounding us to ask for directions to the nearby beach. When my girl screamed out loud notifying me that they took her watch, I tried to run after but unfortunately missed their traces when they turned to the corner of the shopping mall. I have reported the thieves to the nearest police station.",
        "I took out my travel insurance last week before the holiday. It would be much appreciated if you could pay the valuable cost of the watch to me so that I can buy another new one for my girl.  My insurance number is 123456789.",
        "Thank you for having the time to read my letter and I look forward to hearing your prompt action soon.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
