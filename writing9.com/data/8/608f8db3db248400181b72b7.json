        "Apart from working hours, people spend their free time in numerous ways. Some opine that  those who read for happiness would have better creativity and powerful language over others who spend their free to watch TV. I completely agree with this notion. In the upcoming paragraphs, I will put forth my views in detail.",
        "On the one hand, people who read a lot have several benefits. Firstly,they would be able to visualise everything they grasp. To elaborate, people while reading a book or journal would be able to imagine that particular content visually in their mind. Eventually, such activity would improve their ability to imagine. Secondly, besides superior creativity, they would also have  good language skill. To expand, people, while reading would have to be familiar with every word meaning that they encounter. The only with which they could understand the complete content. Definitely, that could enhance their vocabulary. Ultimately they would be able to handle the complex language very easily. For example, according to the survey conducted by the Indian Express, children, those who love to read books are able to write stories and articles in a powerful language. Therefore, having analyzed the above details, the power of reading could be reinforced.",
        "Whereas, individuals who spend time on TV need not have to use deep thinking power. To explain, since they obtain visual experience directly, such people would be more relaxed during viewing TV programmes. Moreover, while watching television, they would be able to perceive details in a simple way. Hence they need not  know about each word meaning. Thus could easily neglect some new vocabulary even if they encounter it.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, people who spend their time  reading would be more refined in their ideas and language than the television viewers. To obtain  complete satisfaction and experience, they would use their brain to imagine."
