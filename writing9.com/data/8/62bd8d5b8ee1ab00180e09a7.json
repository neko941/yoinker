        "Failure and resilience are hot topics nowadays. According to some people, failing means that we did not want to achieve our purpose strongly enough. In my opinion, there are several aspects that can determine our success, and our desire for a specific objective is just one of them.",
        "To begin with, we are all conditioned by external factors. That is to say, despite the fact that we have an aim and we can put a reasonable amount of effort into it, there are people in the journey who will have to give us the opportunity. For instance, students who want to get a scholarship might prepare an excellent application, but it is up to the funding committee to give it or not. In fields such as art or design, those decisions can be even more subjective. Moreover, there are additional aspects of success that we cannot control. We might feel sick during our exam day or unlucky with our questions.",
        "Failure should be culturally perceived as normal. Instead of giving it such a negative connotation by associating it with effort, we should understand it as part of the process. In Europe, failing several times seems to be a burden and everyone wants to hide it. Nevertheless, in America, citizens who fail and do not give up normally set a great example. There are many excellent CEOs who talk with pride about all their failures and how they managed to overcome the obstacles until they reached their desired job position.",
        "In conclusion, there is a number of aspects that can lead us to succeed or to fail, and our ambition is only one parameter. I wish, in the future, people would be more open to failing and admire those who fail and keep trying."
