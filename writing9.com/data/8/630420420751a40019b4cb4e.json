        "My name is Alan White, a repair technician in the Repairs and Maintenance Department. I am writing to give opinions on the recent new winter work uniform consultation.",
        "Generally speaking, the colleagues of my team are quite positive about the new changes to the uniform, the material seems to be more durable, as you may know our job nature guarantees scratches. It is also thicker, which is an important merit because sometimes we need to do work in the server room which is freezing cold.",
        "Nevertheless, there is one thing we want to raise to your attention. Similar to the old uniform, we do not have enough pockets on the trousers. Having these pockets can certainly bring higher efficiencies  as we can assess tools easier in the course of our work. If it is up to us, we would like to have two more pockets on the left side and another pocket with a depth of at least 15cm on the right side to contain longer tools.",
        "Thank you for all your time, I am looking forward to hearing from the human resources department about an updated version of the work uniform.",
