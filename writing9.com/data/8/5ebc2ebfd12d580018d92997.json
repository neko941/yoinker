        "These days, many companies are starting to involve employees in the decision-making process. Some argue that all decisions should be taken by the management only, I, however, agree with those who hold the opinion that personnel\u2019 views must be asked while making any important decision of the company as it increases their stimulation.",
        "On the one hand, it is thought by some that only higher authorities should be allowed to take all decisions of the company. This is because having wide experience and vast knowledge in different fields, do they not only know companies ins and outs very well but also aware of the strength and weakness of workers. This enables them to save time and concentrate on further expansion of the company. For instance, Indian renowned company Tata Motors has successfully opened its branches all over the world due to taking all decisions by experienced managers. Although certainly, their decisions are worth for the company's progress to a certain extent, I believe not all decisions would be accepted by their workers and this gives me a valid reason not to agree with this view.",
        "On the other hand, some individuals are in favour that an employee opinion should be considered while making company decision. To elucidate, if employees are involved in the decision-making process, undeniably, it will increase their morale and they feel like the part of any and would remain in one company for the longer period of time and eventually, this has a profound impact on productivity. For example, a recent report by the BBC News revealed that the majority of successful companies tend to ask the employees' views while taking an important decision of the company and this has resulted in an unexpected increase in the productivity. Therefore, I believe, employee's opinion must be deemed as they feel motivated.",
        "In conclusion, although managers' decisions are invaluable for the expansion point of view, I believe, employees should be involved in making the important decision of the company since it positively effects on productivity and increases their stimulation."
