It is, therefore, necessary for the government to impose a ban on further drilling for oil and gas. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.",

        "Some people assert that the atmosphere and the polar ice caps are facing the problem of damage around the world due to the extreme usage of natural resources such as oil & gas. Consequently, the government should impose a law that restricts further production of oil and gas. I completely disagree with this statement.",
        "It is undeniable that using natural resources as the energy supplies that are used in our daily needs are getting increasing in today\u2019s age of life for a variety of purposes. If the government bans the manufacture of fossil fuels without even notice to the public, we will not be able to do the existing public transportation under such conditions. For example, the sudden stop of supplying fuel to the vehicles will have a significant impact on the transportation of people to go from one place to another. Therefore, a sudden loss of energy will not make to meet the world\u2019s energy needs.",
        "Another rational justification is that if we reduce the production of fossil fuels since we cannot still avoid the need for it in the future. So, the authorized government should impose laws that can prevent high & extra usage of it. For instance, when the fuel price is high, the people can afford to use private cars and they will try to use public transportation instead of it.",
        "In conclusion, not only the government but also the people around the globe have the responsibility to protect our mother nature and the government should take drastic action as soon as possible if someone breaks the law."
