        "Unfortunately, I won't be able to join you all at this time, because I have an important meeting scheduled on the same day. I am not in a position to make changes to the meeting, since we are expecting some foreigners to participate in the meeting, and I am really sorry for that.",
        "However, I hope to visit Australia a couple of weeks after Chris's birthday,so we can go on the trip that we are planning for ages now. How's the climate over there? Here, we are sweating.",
