        "The advertising industry has been growing very rapidly and companies are not sparing any place to promote their products. Sponsoring sports has been proven to be a very effective way of promotion. Some people expound that sponsoring sports for advertisements is good whereas some people are against it. However, I support sponsoring sports for advertisements has more benefits. In the paragraphs to follow, I will discuss both sides and put forth my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, sponsoring sports is beneficial for both companies and players.For instance, Companies can provide equipment to players that they can not afford on their own, consequently players can focus on their game instead of worrying about financial arrangements. Companies can showcase their products during sports and link their name with players. Sponsoring sports gives them media exposure to companies and their products.",
        "On the contrary, it has many cons also associated with it. Sometimes, companies advertise products which are harmful to health such as tobacco. In case, a player linked with the company is not in good form, then it impacts product sales as well. In case, a player is involved in drugs or other wrong activities, it also impacts the company's brand value.",
        "To conclude, sponsoring sports is helpful for the growth of companies and players and the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Although there are several disadvantages associated with it, organizations and governments can take proper measures and follow procedures to overcome and avoid these. I believe, sponsoring sports for advertisements is more beneficial."
