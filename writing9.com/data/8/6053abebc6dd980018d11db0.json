        "At the present time, a plethora of diseases could be cured by the use of advanced medical facilities available in the world. Additionally, there is an abundance of medicines ,moreover, vaccines have been discovered that can be used to recover from childhood abnormalities.In my ,opinion guardians  should be forced by government rules and regulations to  immunised their offsprings from all  infections. Furthermore, they should not be provided with the power to choose whether they want to vaccinate their children or not.",

        "On the contrary, parents more often avoid obtaining rudimentary medical advice during the early age of their child specifically in the rural areas.Having a lack of  knowledge along with awareness, citizens of our nation usually misses the opportunity to immunize their family.The Government should introduce a law mentioning the importance of vaccination before the age of 5 together with its benefits and not allowing society to make the decision on their own,In addition, management should penalize the crowd not following the laws.",
        "In conclusion, the authority should come up with some guidelines mentioning the advantages of using vaccines and not allowing the community to take the option of not taking them.It is extremely necessary for the referencing future of our homeland.the authority should come up with some guidelines mentioning the advantages of using a needle and not allowing the community to take the option of not taking them.It is extremely necessary for the referencing future of our homeland.the authority should come up with some guidelines mentioning the advantages of using dose and not allowing the community to take the option of not taking them.It is extremely necessary for the referencing future of our homeland."
