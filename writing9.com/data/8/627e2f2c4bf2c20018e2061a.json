        "Nowadays, a large amount of people have a huge intention to explore the story behind the accommodation they live in. This essay will provide an explanation of the possible reasons for this phenomenon and describe the way in which the public finds it out.",
        "The primary reason for exploring their residence is due to the huge investment in owning a property. Therefore, they are keen on taking precautious measures to secure their financing, which can be threatening if the property has terrible notorieties. To illustrate, if a criminal act has occurred in a building or a place, such as murder or others, people would be afraid if such incidents happen again. Consequently, this bad reputation could drop the value of the accommodation.",
        "In terms of researching history, one of the most common ways to do this is by asking the former residents about the actual past story about the building. They can help to share brief information about whether the house is safe or not. Furthermore, we can check out the legality of the documents of the building or the estate we stay on to make sure there will be no controversy regarding the land in the future. These would help us to live peacefully without any doubt or fear.",
        "In conclusion, some citizens recently have the ambition to find out the history of their house to prevent predicted issues in the future and live more peacefully. The method usually used for this is asking the previous habitant and checking the essential documents of the building and area."
