Although the participants liked the ambience of the hotel and the services of your courteous staff, they all complained about the food.",
        "Let me explain in detail. Some of the food items served during the event were cold and we found it really hard to eat them particularly the rotis which obviously should be served hot. Another issue was that there was no variety. We had participants from abroad who were not particularly fond of Indian food.",
        "I suggest you install food warmers for all the dishes, and not just for the gravies. I also recommend that you add some western dishes like pasta and toast to your menu.",
