        "Many people consider overpopulation as the main cause of most problems in the world. From my point of view, while many of the world\u2019s issues are caused by overpopulation, I believe that most problems that people are facing already existed before the world\u2019s population explosion.",
        "It is a proven fact that many problems exist due to overpopulation. Firstly, overpopulation puts a strain on the planet\u2019s natural resources. As people need fuel for their cars, an increasing number of people has increased the demand for fossil fuels, such as oil and gas. These resources are unrenewable, and therefore overpopulation will inevitably lead to the depletion of such resources quicker, potentially causing an energy crisis. Secondly, a dense population means a decline in the quality of people\u2019s lives. Life in big cities, such as Beijing, is a good example of this as there is not enough space to accommodate everyone, with lower-class families having to live in very cramped housing.",
        "On the other hand, many issues are inherent in human society, regardless of population size. War, for example, has existed since humans lived in tribes with only a small number of people. Nevertheless, war brings strife and destruction to societies. In addition, discrimination based on race, gender and social standing has plagued millions of individuals, even though these issues are unrelated to the size of the population. Therefore, it is inaccurate to say that over-population is the main culprit behind most of mankind\u2019s problems.",
        "In conclusion, overpopulation can cause many problems to society and individuals, however, there are other factors involved as well."
