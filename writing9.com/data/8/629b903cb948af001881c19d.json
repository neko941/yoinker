        "Many individuals debate on the topic that art classes like painting and drawing are not equally important as other subjects, so schools should remove them from compulsory subjects. While I believe that this subject is important for those who have an interest in it but can become an optional subject and further I will discuss my views in this essay.",
        "Although, art classes play a significant role in improving one's artistic skills. These skills can help folk to explore various career options which require creative skills. For instance, nowadays jobs like gaming or fashion designing have a huge need for artwork, gamers need to make sketches of their characters, and fashion designers make various designs of the dresses in their art books before making the real dress. Thus, art is an important subject for those who want to pursue their career in such jobs.",
        "However, this subject should not be a compulsory part of the curriculum. Students waste their time in these classes because many folks have minimal to zero interest in it and many professions do not require this skill. For example, these classes just waste the time of those children who wants to become engineer, programmer, etc. as the artwork is not required for these professions. Furthermore, children can invest these hours to upgrade those skills which are necessary for their better future. That is why making these classes compulsory part can waste the time of those who want to have a different career.",
        "To conclude, though art classes help to upgrade the artistic and creative skills of children, it should become an optional subject and students can choose whether to attend these classes or not."
