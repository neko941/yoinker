        "In the contemporary epoch, there is irrefutable debate among folk about the interior amenities for society while some governments  quibble with the economic power of the state rather than this,In my perspective, I agree with the upper notion,but in  this discourse, I am going to expound on both edges in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin, with the administration's thinking about economic growth, it is acceptable to some extent that if a country would have an efficient scope of economic progress, it will bring a lot of opportunities that will help a state in its interior and exterior management. To cite an example, According to a recent survey conducted by the University of Karachi stated that India has  better economic support but millions of  individuals live in poverty  because of GDP, this country gets tons of favour and also helps in any kind of emergency situation. As a result, This fact cannot be considered   undeniable.",
        "On the other hand, Another imperative pivotal related to the upper mentioned statement that I believe, internal facilities such as  schooling, hospitality system, human support schemes and these kinds of stuff also act as a necessity instead of just growing annual GDP. In other words, if a society lives in a good condition then it will support its provincial in a  better way. For instance, Ireland people are more helpful to its stats in any crise time because they have provided all their needs by its law. As a result, this trend stands in good stead, as for as augmenting chances of prosperity and excellence is concerned.",
        "In the nutshell, according to the forenamed quarrels,it is true that a good economic figure helps in various fields but I personally believe that If people, general necessities would be excellent then this trend opens country,s door in internal as well as in external ways."
