        "It is said that the youngest people use smartphones for many hours daily. This is mainly due to their parents' busy lifestyle and I believe that this is a negative development as it can cause several health problems among children.",
        "In this modern era,many parents are  busy with their work and they do not spend  enough time with their offspring.Thus, children are alone all day and feel isolated, and to overcome their loneliness they are entwined with  smartphones. For instance, many parents give smartphones to toddlers instead of playing with them they can do their work.",
        "Overusing  smartphones  badly affects children's physical and psychological development ,since it develops obesity and some mental illnesses.In another word, a child who spent many hours with a smartphone tends to sit for a long duration per day.In fact, due to this sedentary lifestyle, children can not burn the extra calories they eat.This causes obesity, a health condition which leads to many cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction. In addition , many parents give mobile phones to toddlers to watch nursery rhymes and this attracts the toddlers and they addict to  phones.This leads to autism which is a common psychological condition among toddlers which is caused due to long hours on the screen.For example,WHO reported that the main cause of obesity and autism among children is due to  overuse of smartphones.",
        "In conclusion, it become a trend to overuse  smartphones among children.This is mainly due to the busy lives of the parents, and I believe that this is a negative development because it becomes a reason for critical health problems among children."
