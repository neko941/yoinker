        "There are no exact methods of assessing one's skills. Exams may be considered one of the procedures to evaluate students' calibre but it must not be the only way to categorise them. I partially agree with this statement.",
        "In a formal situation, exams become more popular throughout the world to judge any student and his or her level of knowledge. Teachers, as well as institutions,are highly organised to take exams so that they can evaluate their pupils for the next steps. It is a well-established system among schools, colleges and universities as well. By scoring the highest, one is ranked topper. For example, in job markets exams are a must to go to the next round in most cases. They sort out employees through the marks they achieve.",
        "Besides exams, there are a lot of ways of judging the level of a student. It may be an oral presentation, communication skills, group meetings, group discussion etc. These technics are very helpful to make a conclusion about a candidate. Sometimes these systems are more accurate than exams. In this modern era, some giant companies and universities are trying to grasp these methods to cope with situations. Such as, many recruitment agencies nowadays mainly focus on the co and extra curriculum activities of a person rather than the grades they acquire. How they talk, how they walk or how they manage a critical situation is a very important criterion rather than taking exams.",
        "In a nutshell, exams are obviously the fundamental criteria to assess someone but it is also important to monitor other than exams. The first exam then viva-voce may be an effective strategy to evaluate both one's proficiency and skills."
