        "Nowadays, a large number of citizens become immigrants due to the search of rich, secure, and comfortable life in other developed nations with different conventions and cultures. While many admit that people should adopt new country\u2019s rules and conventions when they intended to settle there, I strongly agree with this idea because of several benefits and problems that people can face with them.",
        "Disobeying and unconsciousness about host country\u2019s customs and traditions causes\u2019 problem with the immigrants. On the one hand, if a newcomer rejects to accept new environment, it will create a cultural barrier for this new immigrant. This leads to social separation, which has negative impacts on people\u2019s lives. In addition, lack of knowledge of rules and regulations may lead to illegal actions in the new country and make people dissatisfied. For instance, in Dubai, government fine car owner if they found a car with dust on the road and even if it\u2019s in car parking area.",
        "On the other hand, immigrants can easily get approved and gain benefits in a new country if they follow the customs and traditions. Firstly, one benefit is that immigrants behave in accordance with local norms, they will be accepted easily by the local inhabitants, and as a result, they will receive affections and respects as well as some help in any problems. For example, newcomers can get introduced with people easily for their acceptance of new cultures, and people started to think them as one of them. Secondly, practicing host country\u2019s cultures and traditions enables one to participate in any cultural functions and programs in the host country. Immigrants can join the community and share their joy and happiness like their own country.",
        "To conclude, all immigrants who tend to dwell in other countries should follow the customs and traditions of that country, which I strongly believe. It will help to create balance in the society as well as to get acceptance within the community."
