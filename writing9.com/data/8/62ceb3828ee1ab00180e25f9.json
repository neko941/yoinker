        "Arts, health and education are essential to a country. Some people support the government investing in skills, while others prefer it to be in crucial areas such as health and education. In this essay, I will discuss both sides and why I believe more funding should be on the latter.",
        "What are the benefits of the government spending more on arts? Firstly, it can fund more activities, like supporting museums or art gallery exhibitions and preserving local performing arts, for instance, Ulik Mayang in the Northern Malay Culture, which can be educational to the public. On top of that, the funding could build more schools for performing arts and music. For example, there are hardly any art institutes in Malaysia to harness young talents into becoming world-renowned artists. Hence more money will help with the growth of arts in the country.",
        "On the other hand, I believe the government should prioritise its budget for pertinent sectors like health and learning. Health is essential to all citizens, and more funding would cater to more affordable healthcare including medications and outpatient clinics. It can also provide for emergency health scenarios such as the recent coronavirus pandemic. In addition, investing in education increases peoples\u2019 literacy rate and improves the economy as more intellectuals will populate the country to contribute to the GDP and income tax. This can be seen in Singapore, a country with one of the highest IQs globally, which attains the top ten GDPs in the world.",
        "In conclusion, supporting the arts industry financially brings advantages in preserving culture and expanding new talents. However, I believe policymakers must prioritise funding in more critical areas like health and education. After all, survival depends on basic needs, including well-being and literacy."
