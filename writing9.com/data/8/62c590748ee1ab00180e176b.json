        "It is true that at present, most  business  advertisements  underscore that their commodities are new in some respect.There could be several reasons behind this but in my opinion, a highly competitive modern market is the reason and I think it is a mostly  positive development.",
        "It is quite reasonable to assume that competitiveness in present business sectors is one of the main driving forces behind this trend.Since the number of enterprises and companies are proliferated during the last few decades, most of the common items can be purchased easily from most supermarkets or shops with roughly identical qualities and features.Thus, the general public unknowingly desires  uniqueness and innovations.For example, the introduction of artificial paints shook the global market several decades ago,when people have to use natural dyes for colouring.This phenomenon clearly exemplifies that success can be achieved even amidst the common products ,if  a new method is applied in some way.",
        "Although there may be some minor drawbacks, I perceive the  idea of businesses being enthusiastic to search for breakthroughs and presenting some new methods in advertisements generally as a positive  development.If the advertisements remain  true to their words and shed fraudulent notions, it simply means that they have discovered something new.It also promotes other companies to thrive for other new inventions and this could be fruitful for  society as a whole.For instance, the competitiveness of the companies working on groundbreaking products to include in advertisements and present to the viewers  might bring more advanced products both in terms of technology and convenience.",
        "Overall, the emergence of several enterprises lead to this phenomenon and due to the overwhelming benefit of persuading to innovate, this can be considered as a positive trend."
