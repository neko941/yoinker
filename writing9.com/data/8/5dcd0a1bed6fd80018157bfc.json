        "It is undeniable the major purpose of school is to prepare students with academic knowledge, yet, many people argue that the curriculum should adjust to an enjoyable experience. I firmly agree that the teaching methods can add in some entertaining elements to. In this essay, studies of University of Italy and University of Taiwan will be used to prove my argument.",

Therefore, game based teaching is not only fun, but also a very effective way to promote academically.",

Consequently, entertaining subjects are crucial for pupils as well as other subjects.",
