        "These days company buildings have a variety of different sizes. The question is,is it better to task at a small business company or in an enormous building? I personally would choose a small workplace . In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and explain my opinion.",
        "On one hand, even though it is difficult to be excepted by large companies, many individuals would like to work for them. Mainly because they tend to provide better financial states for their employees. The main reason given to support this claim is that enormous size businesses often offer high paychecks and insurance",
        ", which many individuals need. In ,addition the majority of momentous groups are well known by people in the same fields. Which can be very useful to fast workers to put in their CVs . To illustrate, the person who has experience at a well-known company name can find applying for job opportunities extremely easy. therefore, although it can be seen that this selection has some benefits, it's only applied to those who are excepted to work at such companies .",
        "On the other hand, small workplaces force the working community to become more social. This is owing to the increased chances of bumping into other workers. Hence, creating a situation where people must socialize, resulting in a possible job friendship\u00a0. For instance, the creator of a small office In my hometown made sure while he was constructing the building to create as he says \"social areas\" where folks will often meet. In addition, a teamwork atmosphere will be built making people excited to show up and have more energy to work . Therefore, never want to quit their jobs.",
        "To conclude, even though many fancy having jobs at large companies for better payments and CVs , working in small spaces will have better outcomes in a person's social state. My own preference is to perform at a job in a small place ."
