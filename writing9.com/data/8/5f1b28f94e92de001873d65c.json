        "In the twenty first century, undoubtedly, the quality of our lives has been greatly improved by advancements in science and technology rather than works of art. However, I believe that the arts and humanities are still playing an irreplaceable role in lives of modern people because they can teach people a lot about themselves and life in general.",
        "Firstly, the arts provides us with abstract concepts such as beauty matter, while the world of science and technology only has explicit and monotonous notions. This is such a limited view of the world and therefore arts differ in that they modify our outlook on life in a more alternative and spiritual way. For example, when we listen to Mozart\u2019s compositions, we learn more about harmony and joy through the medium of music. Additionally, while we read various classical literature, we gain an insight into the value of sympathy and kindness. Hence, these may not exist in the clinical world of technology and science.",
        "Secondly, the arts also promote the habit of self-reflection. This is because while engaging in activities such as visiting art galleries or reading novels, people will be more likely to have time to contemplate inner values. Consequently, this may remind people of their inner spiritual beauty or the others\u2019 bright side and teach them about both the core values of families and human relationship. Thereby, a more balanced life is formed and a sense of community is encouraged.",
        "In conclusion, in my opinion, arts and humanities still have an important role to play in society despite the benefits of technology because they promote a more spiritual and reflective view of life which necessitate lives of ordinary people. In other words, although technology and science allow humans to live more comfortable, the arts help to preserve humanity values."
