        "I hope you doing great. By the way, did you remember the fantastic news I told you the other week when we were having wine and steak at your place? Actually, because of my amazing performance this past few months at work, my boss rewarded me with  a trip to Korea this summer. And ,definitely I'm not gonna pass this opportunity to take some time off from work.",
        "I was hoping  you could look for my house for the time being. Well, it's not really quite that hard to look after my house. It's just an 85 sqm home with a small backyard. You could also enjoy my tiny swimming pool with Jude while I am away.  I just need you to water my plants and feed my dog, of ,course you know my dog \"Kimchi\".",
        "Moreover, please do some light cleaning if you have some spare time. I would really appreciate it. Just kidding. You have nothing to worry about cleaning my house, I will just call the cleaning agency about that. I'll be gone for just 7-9 days.",
        "Thank you so much. Just let me know if you make it happen. Please?",
        "Kind regards,",
        "Monica your pretty best friend."
