        "Dear Sir/Maam,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my gratitude to the school and staff for allowing me to participate in the Bakery Course that you offered.",
        "What I liked the most about the curriculum is that I can do different designs and shapes of it depending on my liking. I also enjoy doing the precise measurements of the ingredients, although nervous, that I might mistakes. After I finished the course, I can't stop baking at my place and I always bought ingredients before I get home from school.",
        "The course for me was a great one and I learned a lot from it. Recently, I can't stop watching a cooking show in which participants are Asian. Their cuisine is unique compared to what I used to. The show is pretty popular among my peers in cooking. It would be interesting to try and learn their dishes. The school can add it to their lessons and I'll surely enrol in no time.",
        "Once again, thank you for imparting me the knowledge and I hope the school consider my request.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
