        "These days, due to modern technology such as the internet, it seems that shopping is effortless; simply click and wait for it to arrive on your doorstep. Others argue, however, that there are significant disadvantages to online shopping. This essay compares both sides of the argument and outlines my personal opinion regarding the subject.",
        "On the one hand, it is increasingly common and straightforward for people to do most of their purchasing online nowadays. For example, a person can order all their groceries online, delivered directly to their door, saving considerable time and effort. It also saves money because it prevents a lot of impulse spending. Additionally, online shopping gives the consumer access to a vast range of goods from all over the world at nominal prices. Whatsmore it is beneficial for people who are elderly, immunocompromised or have social anxiety.",
        "On the other hand, online shopping is not always as easy as it first might appear. There are several pitfalls, like scams and poorly made products. For example, I once bought a desk online, and when it never arrived, I realised I had been scammed. More commonly, products are falsely advertised; the image looks great, but it is a badly manufactured knockoff in real life. Clothing is particularly awful. On sites like Shein, more often than not, the garments are not as pictured, and they do not fit. At least with real-life shopping, you can try clothes on, assessing the fit and the quality before you purchase.",
        "While online shopping is a fundamental necessity for many people, real-life shopping has benefits one cannot get online. Personally, I prefer not to waste my money on poorly made trash, and I enjoy the experience of shopping in my local community."
