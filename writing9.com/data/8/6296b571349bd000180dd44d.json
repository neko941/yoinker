        "Recently, more and more people consider teaching children at home. Therefore, the debate on whether studying at home can benefit children has been heated. As far as I am concerned, pupils can learn some important social skills in school than at home. In this essay, I will outline the pros and cons and illustrate my own opinion.",
        "To begin with, parents can control the information received by children through homeschool. As children may not have comprehensive moral values, they may listen to or follow their peers' behaviours in order to gain approval in school. For example, students may become violent to avoid becoming victims. Therefore, Parents can stop the bad behaviours and teach them the right moral value if studying at home which can create a good character for pupils.",
        "On the other hand, studying at school can boost the ability for interpersonal communication. As school gathers lots of students of similar age,  children can learn to communicate with others and deal with people. For instance, kids may need to share and learn to compromise while they are playing. Therefore, a sense of selflessness can be built up for children as they will consider others more often subliminally once they get along with a group of people instead of their family.",
        "In conclusion, although educating children at home can prevent them from learning bad behaviours, it is more important for kids to learn interpersonal communication. As human beings living in a group, it is crucial to know how to communicate with others."
