        "Dear Agent,",
        "My name is Khulan Khashdorj. I am one of the customers who flew from Mongolia to the USA last week and lost my suitcase during my trip. Therefore, I would like to follow up regarding it. About the unfortunate incident is that before I enter the check-in departure, I handed my baggage over to the gentlemen who was working on all the customers' suitcases. Then, after almost 20 hours of flight, the plane finally landed on the USA territory and since it was so crowded and had a massive line right at the departure area, I could not pay attention and was concerned about my luggage. Moreover, as soon as I discovered that my luggage is not in the airport, I contacted  the customer service of the airline in order to inform them. After I was notified about my suitcase, they requested to fill out the property lost form and claimed that I have to be on hold for at least 5 business days because they need enough time to investigate what exactly happened and to find my baggage. Now, It has been over a week and I still have not gotten any update regarding this issue.",
        "Please help me to find my suitcase as soon as possible and if you have any data or process to share with me, I would really appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Sincerely, K. Khulan."
