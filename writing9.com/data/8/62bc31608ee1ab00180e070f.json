        "I had a nice journey with you last Monday, 14th June, on the aeroplane. It was so exciting to hear that you have restaurants in my city located in Shanghai. As I am studying an accounting course in my hometown now, and I have spare time during the weekends, I want to apply for the front account service occupation.",
        "The following program will tell you why the job is suitable for me. To begin with, I am good at mathematics.  On the other hand, I always help my mum to calculate the price of vegetables, meat, and fishes, etc. Also, my course includes accounting, tax, and statics, which means I can sit in front of the reception area, and count the overturn of your restaurant. Moreover, It is not far from my home, so I can easily go to work on time, and even do overtime. Thank you for the time to read my letter.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you.",
