        "Water being a precious natural resource of the planet earth, is essential for the survival of any living being. Although potable water is of paramount importance to the existence of life, quantities of freshwater are rapidly shrinking than ever before in the last few decades. This essay discusses various reasons and offers feasible solutions to overcome them.",
        "First and foremost, why drinkable water for humankind is dwindling is because of water wastages, and 70% of the world\u2019s freshwater consumption is for agriculture, and food demand is rising. Also, several studies have revealed that illiterate people tend to wastewater more frequently. In addition, if governments impart education to these individuals, it undoubtedly helps to save and preserve water rather than squandering it. Furthermore, another prominent determinant responsible for water wastage is chemical industries. For example, chemical industries produce unwanted liquid excess generated during the manufacturing process throw it directly into clean and pure water rivers. As such, all these determinants play a crucial part in lessening the portion of sanitary water.",
        "Despite this, there are several remedial steps to minimize the freshwater crisis. The government and large corporations might play a pivotal role. For instance, while government commence campaigns like \u201cSAVE WATER\u201d to illustrate its importance through audiovisual technique, they unquestionably influence every human being to save this scarce resource. Also, the government of developing and developed nations should take stringent actions and charge exorbitant penalty against industry units that pollute sanitary water.",
        "In conclusion, even though reducing drinking water the world over because of chemical factories and lack of knowledge, country administrations and prominent private institutes should drive awareness campaigns to save and preserve potable water for the welfare of all living creatures on the earth."
