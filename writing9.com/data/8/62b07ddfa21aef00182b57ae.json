        "Restaurants are seen everywhere lately. Therefore, the majority of individuals depend on them for meals instead of cooking food at home. As much as there are merits to this trend, there are also certain drawbacks.",
        "Admittedly, there are a plethora of benefits to relying on canteens for food. For one, it is less stressful. In other words, numerous individuals spend long hours in offices and return home tired, so they find it difficult to cook. Purchasing fast foods from eateries can relieve  the stress of cooking. Furthermore, it creates an opportunity to try new cuisines . This is because many cafeterias serve different delicacies which include Chinese food and carrot fried rice that many people have not tasted before. Visiting such places gives one the chance to see their menu list and request  a new food on it.  For instance, I got to know about Chinese rice from kitchen cuisine located in my area. I decided to try it and I enjoyed it. It has  been my favourite since then.",
        "However,  there are also numerous demerits of getting to eat from canteens. First, most of their meals are expensive. That is to say, the amount you will spend on a delicacy in an eatery can be used to cook a weekly meal in one's home and as a result, their regular customers end up not having any savings. In addition, most of their dishes are unhealthy  They make use of low-quality ingredients so as to get higher profits  and many of their foods contain high calories which have detrimental effects on people's health. For example, the junk food being sold in most restaurants contain high cholesterol which put individuals at risk of obesity.",
        "In conclusion, eating from a cafeteria has the advantages of giving chance to try food one has not taken before and relieving individuals from  the stress of making meals and the disadvantages in terms of being costly and unhealthy."
