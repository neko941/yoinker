        "Hope this letter finds you in pink of your health. As you know that I came to your city last month for one week ,unfortunately I was unable to meet you there due to some unavoidable circumstances.",
        "I am sorry from the depth of my heart for not seeing you at your place. Basically, I was there to care for my maternal aunt who is in her last stage of cancer and received palliative care at home from nurses. As I promised her to stay with her for a few days, however, when I reach there, after 5 hours she passed away.",
        "Apparently, I phoned my parents to reach there and attend all the death ceremonies for the last 7 days. This is the reason that I was not able to see you and get no time to write to you. I guess you will understand the whole condition. There was a sad moment for my mother and other family members that's why I have to be there to console them.",
        "I am planning to come again there for the transfer of the property of my maternal aunt next week. It would be great if you could meet me. I would come there Wednesday so it would be ok to meet on Friday or Saturday evening. Write to me when you will be available so that I would plan accordingly.",
