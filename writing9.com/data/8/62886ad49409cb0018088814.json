        "The trend of university students studying abroad as part of their studies is increasing these days. It is thought by some people that it is much worse than studying locally. In this essay, I will outline the perceived drawbacks and benefits of overseas study, and explain why I take the view that the positives of this far outweigh the negatives.",
        "Certainly, there are several disadvantages to studying overseas. One of them is high costs, including housing rent, tuition fees and food costs.  Students who cannot afford those fees are going to have more pressure which may have an adverse impact on their mental health. Another fear is that international students will have a bad academic performance. Clearly, International students will live in a different environment where they do not have any folks or friends, which means they need to spend time learning local culture. This could lead to them cannot have enough time to study.",
        "Despite these negatives, studying abroad also has its advantages. First of all, it can broaden students' horizons. For example, those people who choose to study abroad can have a valuable international experience because they will learn about different cultures and across-culture communications, which can be used in future work. Additionally, they will become bilingual people. International students can speak a foreign language fluently because they are forced to speak the local language with native people in a foreign environment.",
        "In conclusion, although some still argue against studying overseas, their concerns can be easily addressed. The benefits, therefore, outweigh the disadvantages, in my view."
