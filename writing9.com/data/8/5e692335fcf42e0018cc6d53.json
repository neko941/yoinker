        "Sport continues to be a controversial topic in the school curriculum, just as athletics itself has become a controversial industry in some respects. There are valid opinions on both sides, which I will now consider.",
        "On the one hand, some people feel that pastime uses up time, which could be better spent on academic subjects such as exam preparation. In addition, it might be said that it is unwise to force children to do activities which they have no interest in. After all, some youngsters are just not sporty, and should be allowed to study instead. Finally, there are question marks over the wholesomeness of athletics itself, with drugging and corruption scandals increasingly common, as we see in cycling at present. Some people believe that this lack of morals sets a poor example to young people.",
        "On the other hand, though, one major benefit of athletics is that it helps children\u2019s physical development at an important stage. If all their time was spent studying, they would become unfit and their minds would eventually suffer. Furthermore, supporters of institute athletics emphasize the importance of team building in sports such as football or hockey, which is often felt to be an excellent preparation for adulthood. Finally, many people feel that a competitive spirit, so important today, is fostered by sports at an early age. It is notable, for example, that many successful business people excelled in a game at the faculty.",
        "Overall, I feel that pastime should be compulsory for institute children, because the positive effect on their mental and physical development outweighs the negatives. This is as long as children are given a wide range to choose from, to ensure their interest is high, and that the sports industry itself maintains the highest standards of conduct."
