        "First of all, I would like to echo the positive opinion of the visitors, as they passed out by the modern architecture of the hotel. They also had a wonderful opportunity to see the beautiful scenery of the forests around the hotel during lunch.",
        "However, although the guests were satisfied with the buildings and the scenery, they complained about the food they were served for dinner. For example, although they were served a three-course meal, it lacked a soup and an appetiser. Apart from the fact that these were missing, the main course was cold and the dessert was not sweaty.",
        "It follows that  you should keep warm before serving the meal. Also, you can vary your meals by adding vegetables, because some participants are only vegetarians.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you.",
