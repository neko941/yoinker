        "There has been an argument about whether we should discover and scrutinize our family background or concentrate on our present situations. In this essay, I shall discuss both perspectives and explain what I think.",
        "To begin with, studying deeply about our ancestors' history can enhance the comprehension of our past culture and develop new techniques at present. There have been an enormous number of influential groups, and the offsprings and younger generations still represent their signature. One of the most famous families in Thailand, for instance, has owned various lucrative businesses and estates for more than 50 years. In fact, they relentlessly continue the plans and become more and more wealthy because the youth are taught to be patient like what their ancestors did. Also, their working styles are imitated or adapted from the old ones. Therefore, learning the events taken place in the past time can improve and be used in our current scenario.",
        "On the other hand, some people don't have any significant remembrance about the origin. Taking my family as an example, I don't discover or seek any interesting stories about my previous generation as my parents always teach us to focus on upcoming opportunities and adapting to the modern society. Due to the changes which frequently occurred, the elderly's stories are limited in certain circumstances. In my opinion, people, who are struggling with their daily life and matter, usually perform the best of them in everyday and only keep the past, both wonderful and sorrowful, as experiences and lessons.",
        "In conclusion, it depends on how the history works and benefits us in nowadays time. Although some can get beneficial effects from following and researching on the background, some, who don't find it necessary, are still able to succeed in their life."
