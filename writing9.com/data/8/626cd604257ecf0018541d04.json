        "There is an argument about helping the state to preserve cultural values and art by donating its facilities. while knowing the government could invest in some more critical topics such as environmental problems or educational matters, I believe that local cultures of every country are part of this heritage and at the same time art portrays the history of a nation beautifully. So both the governing and private companies have the responsibility to conserve it as they can many benefits for people and history.",
        "Without any doubt, these days, society is faced with a wide range of problems affected by climate change and global warming issues, which need capitalizing to decrease its underlying repercussions.

        "In conclusion, while knowing that there are many vital topics that should be invested by the governing, I would say, it is an irrefutable fact that corporation and cooperation between the state and the private sector are necessary. In this way, we will witness our cultural diffusion around the globe. I think it is an undeniable source of income which could not condone."
