        "Music plays a very important role in today's life. While certain people believe ,it is just a form of relaxation. Others feel, that songs make a tremendous effect on  society. In my opinion, communities are much influenced by music for widening  socialism between individuals and improving the solution in the educational domain.",
        "Musical themes are effective for developing socialism among people. Especially, in the event of social gatherings. Individuals tend to speak with  unknown people to create a well-known contact. For example, last week , we had a party with people from different communities and help us to know each other. In addition, the person uses  music for relaxation and stress buster. They said that the theme has some medication to overcome workplace pressure. Undoubtedly, it is an excellent tool for combining people as one as well as peacefulness in their personal life.",
