        "I hope you are doing well in Singapore. I am writing this letter to you as I would like you to know about my study plan at National Technology University (NTU) Singapore and I want to ask you how to apply for part-time jobs.",
        "To begin with, it is a great chance for me to get an offer from the university in order to study  Electronic -Engineering Courses as a full-time student and this is for two-year courses. As you know, the courses and accommodation fees in Singapore are very expensive. Therefore, I would like to do a part-time job while I am studying in order to meet my basic needs.",
        "To be frank with you, I am not quite sure how to search or apply for a part-time job. Moreover, I am pretty sure that you are able to help me since you have been working  there for over five years and you could give me advice on some job applications that are useful especially for students to find a part-time job.",
        "I hope you could help me with this case and see you in the near future.",
