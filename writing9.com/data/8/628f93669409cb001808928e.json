In other words, most people have to work around the clock in order to support their families and they may need to work overtime if they were requested by their boss. As a result, they have to spend the most time at work and after ,that they don\u2019t go in for doing exercises as they are tired. Secondly, they need to learn new things at night to get a promotion at work or a good job. For example, in this competitive world, working people continue to learn about technology such as networking or other IT technologies when they reach home after working in the daytime.",
        "It is obviously true that the possible effects of lacking exercise or an inactive lifestyle become obesity because of their sedentary work.
