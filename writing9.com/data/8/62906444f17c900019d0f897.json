        "Dear Sir,",
        "I am writing this letter to bring into your eyes that I am a permanent resident of Amritsar near Airport Chownk. I heard the news about making that Airport more developed.",
        "Although, It will be beneficial for myriad passengers yet it brought some disadvantages also. The residential area near the port is already congested and after the implementation of this project, it will face numerous problems such as Traffic jams and noise pollution due to an increase in the number of flights which makes me worried that how daily office-goers will reach their workplace on time.",
        "Because of the aforesaid reasons, I am afraid that  this advancement will pose a great threat to the environment. Moreover, There are multifarious institutions besides it, that will face these negatives. Also, Students who are studying in these colleges will not be able to concentrate on their studies due to disturbance created by planes.",
        "Therefore, I being a citizen of this nation, request to you please oppose this change in that area and try to implement it in any other location far from the city. I hope you will take into consideration, serving the community in a better way.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
        "Kuljeet Kaur."
