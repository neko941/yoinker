The majority of people give cellular phones to their face for various purposes  and believe that it is beneficial for them. While others are against this viewpoint.  I open that phones should not be given to the children as this may lead to  health issues and  elevate dependency child on cell phones.",
        "To embark with mobile phones can be used as a source of information for young children. The availability of different videos and audios  related to their curriculum helps them to learn  concepts fast and easily. For instance,  a report of Survey has revealed that children watching rhymes on phones have more sound recognition  and easily learn different languages at a tender age.  Moreover, there are many children  who follow various recreational activities through mobile phones. Dancing and singing are the most common talents,   which get flourished by watching  videos on mobile.Thus,  it is a great platform which gives young stars  opportunity  to explore interests.",
        "Despite of the aforementioned benefits  of the mobile, there are numerous adverse effects on a child's growth. The most common risk of cell phones used by kids is the radio waves  which penetrate deep into the brain and cause multiple health disorders. For example, a  paediatrician  has claimed that children mobile phones excessively  are more prone to ocular problems  and anxiety disorders.  Another unfortunate  impact  of portable phones  is addiction of  using them. Children soon get habituated and  mesmerized  with vibrant colours of mobile screens, which leads to  feeling of irritability and impatience.  Therefore, to avoid these consequences must not give  mobile phones to the children.",
        "To conclude,  although,  there are various benefits of mobile phones. But, detrimental impacts on children psychology  could  not be  denied. Hence,  parents should teach proper use of smartphone  to the children and must set  time limits for its use."
