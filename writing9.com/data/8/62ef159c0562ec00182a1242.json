        "It is believed some people who work as doctors and engineers should be obliged to work for the country where they did their training. Otherwise, there are some perspectives that think they should have a choice in where they want to work. In this essay, I will discuss both views of these statements.",
        "One of the main advantages, when people work in the country where they did their training, is that they can understand specifically where they work (1). Firstly, if people choose to work in the training places, they do not have to learn all the rules again because they are \uf0e8 get used to them. Also, people will not adapt to a new situation again, due to the period that they trained there, they have known most of the people. Secondly, they will gain government funding and respect, for example, they are considered as a person that dedicate all of their efforts to that place and that country.",
        "On the other hand, if people want to have opportunities to work in another country, they still take advantage of that action (2). Initially, people are able to have better self-esteem since they have many challenges to deal with by themselves. Starting with making new relationships to learning all of the rules. Moreover, they can obtain better foreign language skills, in fact, if they work in another country, then they have to learn that country\u2019s language. As a result, being \u2018immersed\u2019 in the language is a great opportunity to build their listening and speaking skills.",
        "In conclusion, I personally believe that people should be free in where they want to work, in order to build a free and fair society by not forcing people to do what they do not want to."
