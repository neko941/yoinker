        "There is a growing trend whereby residents are researching the history of their homes. This is due to a natural curiosity and practical concerns and should be done through official channels.",
        "Many are interested in the past of their home because they desire to link with history and are worried about potential structural faults. The first reason is analogous to exhaustively studying family genealogy. By researching one\u2019s ancestors or place of residence, it is possible to understand and establish a connection with the past. Moreover, there is a pragmatic reason related to historic construction methods. Older homes, in particular, may have employed unsafe techniques or materials that will degrade, creating the risk of structural damage and, in the worst cases, collapses. By learning about the house and the period when it was built, residents can take the necessary steps to ensure the house is structurally sound.",
        "The method for carrying out such specialized research involves requesting local records. It is possible to do initial research through \u201cword of mouth\u201d and collecting relevant stories in a community. However, this information may be unreliable, and therefore an individual should endeavour to contact their local building authorities. In most countries, it is possible to register  freedom of information requests and receive the required documents from municipal offices. Governments have little incentive to protect such information and are likely to be receptive and helpful in offering assistance. Residents can then be assured they have the most trustworthy information possible in order to better understand the history of their home and any possible defects in its construction.",
        "To conclude, some today gather information concerning the history of their home to understand the past and guarantee their safety. This development is advisable and the authorities should comply and encourage such fact-finding."
