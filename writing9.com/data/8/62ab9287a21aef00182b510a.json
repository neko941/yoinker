        "I am writing this letter in regards to your new houses construction project next to my house at 1300, Dallman Road, Innisfil.",
        "Firstly, I requested your administration team for a detailed project plan and they have sent your architecture plan to my home. However, I  received an incorrect document and after frequent follow-ups, I received the right plan. I reached out to the local municipality for initial clarifications around area measurements which are almost addressed by local community members.",
        "To explain further, Plan is incredible and very thoughtful. I am impressed and excited to see the new suburb next to my house; Nevertheless, I noticed you're blocking the fire way and the whole backyard is dedicated to the patio.",
        "To address the above-mentioned issues, You can provide more space between my house and subsequent houses to allow fire vehicles to move freely in case of emergencies. I suggest you  reduce the patio size so that owners can use backyard space for gardening that will provide a green view from my balcony.",
        "Please respond at your earliest convenience.",
        "Yours faithfully,",
