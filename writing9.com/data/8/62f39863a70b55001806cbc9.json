        "Dear Sarah,",
        "Firstly I\u2019d like to say that extremely happy that you decide to join this camping program  this summer and hope you could make the most out of it to recharge your batteries to enable you to keep working hard once you get back.",
        "As I\u2019ve heard there will be too more entertaining programs included in the tour schedule which will make this holiday more adventure than ever, the tour program contains a daily show of different amateur bands which is basically dancing and singing every night. furthermore, a green tour is added to the program in which there would be long walking and exploring the mountain and virginal nature where there is a long river and waterfall in there that enable us to swim in there. Last summer only playing different games and sports, swimming in the outdoor pool, a white party and drink were organized. It seems we will have so much more fun this year.",
        "Remember to bring proper shoes and clothes to stay over and suitable for mountain climbing since I remember you had some problem with your foot , you may find it a bit harmful and challenging, besides, if you still go to bed early you may find the night shows somehow annoying.",
        "Oh, I forgot to tell you that I wish to join camping most probably if I could manage my jobs till then.",
        "Looking forward to meeting you soon.",
        "all the best,",
