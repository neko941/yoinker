        "The controversial topic concerning the people who take risks in their professional and personal lives never fails to attract public attention. There has been a heated debate on whether it can provide benefits to our society or not. In this essay, I shall elaborate that the advantages and drawbacks of this trend before deducing the proper conclusion.",
        "First of all, it is quite reasonable for me to believe that the idea of promoting a life full of risks does provide several merits. The first point in this regard to the issue is that the perk of chances in a job contributed to the advancement of the subject. For instance, to give time to work and get success. As a result, it can be beneficial for both old and new generations across the world.",
        "In contrast, it is commonly known as the fact that our personal lives also require risky environments. Nevertheless, this statement holds water to some extent. Moreover, it should be pointed out the priorities of domestic life. For example, poor parents took any risk to fulfil their child's demands and needs. Furthermore, these examples can be significant factors that ought to be considered.",
        "In conclusion, due to the aforementioned reason, we may safely conclude that the positive impacts far outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, I strongly recommend keeping this trend in the future for societies to take careful steps to mitigate potential problems. In short, the topic is very informative while the plus factors are enormous, the drawbacks should not be overlooked."
