        "In the present day, technology brings advantages into our life. Purchase everything online, it is not unique anymore, more and more people choose to buy things online as their first choice. In my opinion, shopping online has several benefits over physical shops, which brings outstanding advantages for communities.",
        "To begin with, traditional shopping has a few drawbacks to people in modern life. As everyone is busying on their life, make time to go shopping become a kind of difficult desk. For example, for people who usually work overtime, it can be assumed that all shops are closed when they finished their work. This not only inconveniences for the public but also will impact the sale result of shops. Moreover, there are more reasons caused the public would prefer online, as it takes more time to find the products and carry them.",
        "On the other hand, internet shops bring the benefits not only saving time but also easy to operations. For example, booking a trip, online stores would show perfectly packages with prices for people who worry about over the budgets. Secondly, buying things on the internet, no need to worry about the time of staying in the shops as visual shops there is no traffic. Furthermore, online shops have provided diverse options for consumers and they are easy to research just only by clicking the mouse.",
        "In conclusion, although traditional shops have provided outstanding services, nowadays, the public tends to focus on time-saving and conveniences, which make online shopping popular."
