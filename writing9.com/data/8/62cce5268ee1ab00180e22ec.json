        "Nowadays, technology plays a vital in our daily life. People have the liberty to work and live where they want to  due to the increase in transportation and communication technology. Some people appreciate this development and others think that it has drawbacks. I personally believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of technology and transport in the forthcoming paragraphs.",
        "To begin with, there are numerous advantages of communication technology and transport. Now, People have more options to work. Some people prefer to work from home and some prefer to commute daily to an office. There are different types of transport available private and public. It is people's personal choice to choose them. Moreover, they do not need to stay away from their parents now they can easily travel via bus, car, or bike. For instance, one of my friends is work from home. He has flexible timing to work and he has also a healthy relationship with his family. It is a really appreciable approach.",
        "On the other hand, some people think that there are some cons to this approach. Firstly, carbon emission increases due to an increase in transport on the road. There are some environmental issues. Secondly,  people's lifestyles become sedentary. They have some physical issues such as obesity, diabetes and cancer. To illustrate, a survey conducted by Uk found that 70% of people are suffering from diabetes and obesity due to sedentary lifestyles. In addition,  most of them  work from home.",
        "To conclude, in my opinion, this development has both pros and cons. I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. People have lots of options to work they can enjoy a better lifestyle."
