        "I am writing this letter to express my strong interest in the Mandarin tutor position listed on Indeed.com.",

        "Additionally, aside from my language skill, I am an expert in cooking as well, which means I could teach your children to make authentic Chinese cuisine after the language lessons.",
        "Not only does my experience make me a competitive candidate, but my passion for helping students grow solid communication abilities and introducing Asian culture to them have also been the biggest reasons that I apply for this job.",
