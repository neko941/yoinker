        "Despite the harm that cars and motorcycles cause to the environment, people still continue to use them. This situation can be explained by the fact that these vehicles are more convenient than any other mode of transportation and the social status they provide; however, this problem could be tackled using a few tactics, which are going to be discussed in this essay.",
        "To begin, there are various reasons why people prefer to use their cars or motorcycles. The main reason is the convenience these vehicles provide, and this is because they usually are faster and more comfortable than public transportation, for instance. Another contributing factor to this is the social status that these vehicles provide. To illustrate, some people think that if a person commutes using public transportation then they are poor and could not afford to buy a car. This is a social concept that pressures people into using cars even if they do not need to.",
        "Nevertheless, this issue could be tackled using a few methods. Firstly, the government needs to invest in public transportation to make them more comfortable and faster than they are at the moment. This way, more people would consider using them. Secondly, the use of cycling could be encouraged more, since it is not only better for the environment but also for the individual's health. This could be done through awareness campaigns using social media platforms. The government could also provide bicycles for public use, following the example of Amsterdam, which is a city with a high number of cyclists.",
        "In conclusion, although people are aware of the dangers that cars and motorcycles pose to the environment, they continue to use them because of the high social status and the comfort they provide. There are a few methods the authorities could use to approach this issue, including developing better public transportation and encouraging the use of bicycles."
