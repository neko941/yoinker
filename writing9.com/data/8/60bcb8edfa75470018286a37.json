        "There is no doubt, individuals enjoy to do shopping either  way online shopping or offline. However, some people believe that only internet shopping is the best way but on the opposite side,some say it has a bad impact. In this essay, I will discuss both views and in my perspective, visiting  markets is more convenient than others.",
        "To begin with, there are a plethora of reasons why markets is  preferable. First of all, when customer visit for shopping in the market they can actually experience  the product which they will be going to purchase ,therefore, they would have more satisfaction . Secondly, individuals can get personalized recommendation from workers because when people are in a shopping mall they get easily fumbled and they not able to choose one particular thing which they want actually. Take an example of a survey conducted in  India in 2010 which shows that majority of people pleased with having face to face shopping.",
        "On the other side, although, shopping malls have more benefits , one can not ignore the drawbacks of this as well. indeed, visiting  shopping centres is totally time-consuming and they may forget actually purpose. For example , in a big bazaar, people who distracted by the different king of attraction of things. Thereby, a lot of money spent by them on the product which they do not need. in this way, actual purpose forgetting by them. At the same time, individuals are not able to compare the brand which is best for them or not.",
        "In  conclusion, cyber shopping has been impacting everyone lives in both ways  are negative as well as positive. but in my view, offline shopping centre  better instead of others"
