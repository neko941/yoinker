        "It is believed that verbal conversation is  stronger than written communication. I  do not agree with the statement completely and this essay will explain why.",
        "On the one hand, using oral communication is showing more intention with each other than writing. People prefer to exchange their thoughts, ideas, expressions and emotions with face-to-face talk and that help to understand each other or groups who are communicating. For example, in the lecture student can talk and discuss with the lecturer directly and could clear and understand  all area of the subject they are studying. Furthermore, for the development and sustainability of  society verbal communication is doing a big part and it is the basic part of social interactions.",
        "On the other hand, with some disadvantages of oral communication like language barriers, long-distance etc, writing is the major option to do those communications. Nowadays, with the hectic lifestyle, people do not have much time to talk with their families, friends, parents even neighbours. So they are choosing a suitable way of communicating like text messages, letters, emails and  some notes. For instance, social media is the main thing to chatting and texting each other in present and still growing popularity of that.  In addition,  communicating difficulties like language differences  and explaining details could  ignore by the latest technology using for written communication.",
        "In conclusion, it is clearly showing speaking communication is mightier than writing but partially can agree with the statement because with present situation with the world both are more important."
