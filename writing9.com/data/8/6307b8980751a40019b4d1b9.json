        "Nowadays, getting a job is a bit difficult for individuals due to more and more competition for one job in the world. A large number of people believe that  good employees can be achieved only by graduating from universities, while others believe that it is better to start work after school and have expertise in the world of work. In this essay, I will look at both views and I will explain my opinion in the following paragraphs.",
        "On the one hand, graduating from university has many chances for individuals to get guaranteed jobs. To illustrate this, In prestigious universities have many famous professors who help their students to gain more practical skills along with theoretical knowledge from them, and as a result, it will beneficial for them  to get a good job in the future. Also, many famous universities provide campus placement for their graduate students on their ability. For example, Amity university provides a guaranteed job for every individual who is pursuing their degree from this university along with a high salary package and a good future career. Moreover, having a strong academic background from a prestigious college have many chances for job opportunities.",
        "On the other hand, there are many reasons why some people think that it is better to work after high school and have expertise in a particular work.  Firstly, having an expert in a particular job has many chances to get placed in good companies. For instance, take my friend Anil, who joined \"MacDonald\" as a crew member after finished high school and gained experiences from there, and now he has recently been appointed as a manager of a particular \"McDonald's\" restaurant. Hence, work after schooling and expertise in a particular field have more chances to be placed in a good company.",
        "To conclude, after considering all, In my opinion, I think that both methods have equal benefits in their own perspectives because having experience in a particular field helps them to get a job in a good organisation. However, having a bachelor's degree from a famous university has many chances to a guaranteed job."
