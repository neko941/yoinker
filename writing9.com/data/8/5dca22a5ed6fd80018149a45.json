        "Hi Dave",
        "Thank you for taking care of the house and pet while I am away. I wanted to drop a note to let you know about some important details. I will be in Fort Myers this week staying at Courtyard Marriott gulf coast town centre. In case you need me , give a call at 998567853.",
        "Tommy , my dog eats twice a day around 12:00 clock in the noon and 7:00 p.m in the afternoon and the dog food is present in the top most shelf of the kitchen. It would be very nice of you , if you can take him out for a walk every afternoon .Also please don't forget to cover him with clean sheets at night, otherwise he will catch a cold.",
        "Secondly please don't forget to turn on the motion detectors when you leave the house and turn it off when you are back as a safety measure. Also the two plants beside the window need watering every alternate day.",
        "Even though I will be back in 7 days it would be good if you can vacuum the house everyday as Tommy sheds a lot of hair which might trouble you.",
        "Thanks again for all the help. See you soon",
        "Lots of love",
