        "I am writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction with the management of Railway Station. Recently, I travelled from Chandigarh to Goa via Expressway which I booked online in the month of February and my train was on the 27th of July.",
        "I always preferred to book in advance to avoid any issues with the waiting list. However, when I reached the station on a given date then I found, that my name was not on the list. I was super disappointed and I tried to enquire from the ticket counter but they didn't give me any valid reason. Instead, they were putting blame on me, that I should get it double-checked before coming and so on.",
        "I faced a big issue due to the cancellation of my seat, and I had to cancel my business meeting on  short notice. Moreover, my company was not happy with me at that point and in fact, they cancelled all my future meetings. I felt so ashamed only because of the poor management of your department.",
        "To void this problem I want to suggest a software to manage all passenger bookings, which can help your staff in checking all the details in less than a minute. I do not want this same inconvenience with  someone else.",
        "I hope you find this letter on a positive note and take an immediate action",
