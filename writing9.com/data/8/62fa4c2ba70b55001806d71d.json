        "My name is Ben and my house is just two blocks away from yours. Unfortunately, I'm no good at cooking and laundry, however, you can leave the heavy and tiring work to me. I'm also good at repairing broken things, like chairs, doors, windows, etc. If you have something that needs fixing, you can count on me, as long as it's not an electrical problem.",
        "I'm applying for a scholarship program abroad and I have to take an exam to be eligible. This summer, I decided that I'll devote myself to my studies so I can pass that test. Even so, I need a breather from time to time in order for me not to get bored. I can also earn money while helping you on that job, hence, it is an advantage for me.",
        "I can go to your house after lunch, because I have chores in the morning. I also have to be back by 6:30pm since I have to study for my exam.",
