        "In  the modern era, gender discrimination is decreasing than before. It is a breakthrough change in our society. Although some people think that companies should hire more male workers than female, workplaces are prioritizing men and women equality. In my view, it is a positive step and can bring benefits to our society.",
        "When males and females are working together in one association, they earn exorbitant profits. This is simply because between them, good bonding grows up and they are discussing any issues with each other. They share effective ideas also. For example, in my office men and women ratio is 50:50. Because of this equality, our company get lots of profit than before. When male staff does not work properly and gets distraction, they help them in every situation. Our women workers are co-operative. If the company will not hire women, they will not keep their position. That\u2019s why every company should maintain equality.",
        "On the other hand, if companies circulated equality for men and women, they will save more valuable time. Man and women are working together and they will finish a large project on time. One kind of competition grows up between them and they successfully complete any complicated task by the deadline. In my country, for instance, most of the time we see, because of this less staff company will not finish their work in the time. Overseas buyers are so punctual and strict about dates. Because of this ,lateness they cancel the deal and never bring any project to the same company. When companies hired equal  males and females, they do not face this type of problem.",
        "In conclusion, every workplace should balance man and women's equality. While lots of companies achieve their goal doing this, why we will not follow this term? I strongly feel that we need to give value to equality, it will be worth full for every workplace."
