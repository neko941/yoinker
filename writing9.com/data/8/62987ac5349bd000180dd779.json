        "As a resident of the Lokhandwala neighbourhood, I would like to bring your attention to the commuting challenges faced by the people in our vicinity.",
        "There is  notorious congestion round the clock in our area due to the narrow and abysmal roads, which hamper the public transportation. Also, behemoth aggregators like Ola or Uber companies deny our car rides because their tyres get worn out. Moreover, umpteen number of people get in the public vehicles such as buses, yet a few of them abstain by looking at the overcrowded bus.",
        "I would like to propose that we may need to increase the width of the pathway. Apart from this, carpooling should be encouraged and the frequency of the public vehicles could be multiplied. Additionally, if we have ring route buses running from our area to the nearest railway or the metro station then people will find it easier to roam around.",
