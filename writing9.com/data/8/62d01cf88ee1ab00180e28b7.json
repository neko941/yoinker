        "It is indubitable that technology has been utilized legally and illegally to monitor individuals\u2019 behaviour. Despite the fact that technology plays a vital role in solving the difficulties of human beings, the overuse of technology probably infringes human rights. In my opinion, I strongly suggest that the advantages are less than the disadvantages.",
        "Taking advantage of technology to monitor humankind may be conducive to maintaining social security. For example, as  criminal incidents happen, the police are able to use surveillance cameras to enforce the investigation of the whereabouts of criminals. Another instance is that the government can regularly track the footprints of people who have close contact with confirmed cases by cell phone tracking during the period of the coronavirus pandemic. Hence, it seems that making good use of technology to keep surveillance on individuals is beneficial to protect society.",
        "However, most people are not sensitive enough to figure out that they have been under the surveillance of technology. And that is why I disagree that technology, used to take control of individuals, is not a better idea. For instance, parts of countries throughout the world often use security cameras and websites to control their citizens\u2019 thoughts to consolidate the regime. In addition, if the enforcement administrations overuse the technology to deal with cases, human rights would evaporate. At the last, the culprits can use the Internet and mobile phones to deceive victims to obtain their interests. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the shortcomings of technology used to monitor our acts are more than its benefits.",
        "To sum up, it is apparent that the downsides overweigh the upsides of technologies taking control of our lives. Accordingly, the government ought to set up a comprehensive law toward technology to prevent any malicious action against people and further champion their human rights. Most importantly, defending our rights when necessary is no ground for blame."
