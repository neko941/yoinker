        "I purchased the camera Nokia-770 DSLR from the Avenue Branch. It was having the issue of battery operated shutter. As a result , while switching off the Camera, the shutter was not closing  automatically. The next day I visited the branch and explained the problem to the company officer. He advised me the camera will be sent to the central workshop for repair. They will inform me accordingly.",
        "However, after a week, Unfortunately, I did not get any response from them. Therefore, I would like to draw your attention to the necessary action. Firstly, replace the camera with a new one or if it is not available, kindly refund me the money. Secondly, inform your staff to follow the commitment and timeframe as they agreed, otherwise it will definitely impact your sales and drop the number of customers.",
