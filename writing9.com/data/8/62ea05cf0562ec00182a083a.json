        "There are those who opine that advertising is a good strategy to persuade people to purchase stuff whereas, those with alternative stances do not concur with the effect of advertising to get  society's attention to buy things. In this essay, I discuss both sides of the argument and then I will give my own perspective which is in favour of  advertising having a significant impact on the community.",
        "There are some reasons supporting those who think that  advertising has a great effect on people. Firstly, the majority of  people are surrounded by the media and the internet. What I mean by this is that, in recent years,people are using  television and social media in every situation. For example, in Iran, most of the society uses Instagram for hours  a day. As a result, the advertisements which are shown in these media affect the community especially the youngsters unconsciously.Secondly, the business owners try to persuade people to buy the things which are not necessary for their lives. Take  electronic devices as an example. In the majority of cases, people buy  things that are useless because of the impact of television advertisements. One result is that  after a while, people realize that the products which were bought from some companies are not useful and they are just persuaded by the advertisements.consequently, business owners get more profit and make their companies bigger.",
        "On the other hand, there are some arguments that people are more aware of the impact of advertising and do not buy  things under the pressure from the media. For instance, in some countries, people do not trust  tv shows which advertise some items including kitchen appliances. This can be the result of  community awareness. Another reason is the economical situation. In many countries, the average income of most families has declined in recent years. A good example of this would be Iran. Most of the society is struggling with financial problems and prefer to spend their money on  needs  are vital like renting an apartment or buying food. Subsequently, this is a great reason why advertising does not work in this country.",
        "In conclusion, to reiterate I believe both sides have merits. On balance, it is my firm opinion that most of the society is impressed by advertisements because of social media which surrounded us and the pressure of the business owners to sell their products to us. Should people make a balance in their purchases and buy the things which they need, the advertising trend would be beneficial for both people and companies."
