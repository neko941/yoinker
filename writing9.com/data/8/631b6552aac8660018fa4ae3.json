        "I am an HR manager of a manufacturing company writing a letter concerning some issues faced by our attendees during the full day general meeting held  last week at the Ball Room.",
        "It is worth mentioning that our representatives, fortunately, liked the hotel's appearance too much. In addition, they appreciated the warm welcome given by the hotel staff and their services. Also, they were happy with the meeting arrangements, sound system and other utilities.",
        "The main concern which they highlighted regarding the food which was served during lunchtime. Firstly, there were limited varieties for vegetarian people. Secondly, the condition of the bread was too bad. The soup was salty and sour. Many people were unhappy due to the overall quality of chicken curry and rice.",
        "In view of the above, I would highly recommend focusing on  food items. Your chefs should be experienced and should not be done such mistakes. Moreover, all the food items should be tested  before serving on the table in order to take necessary action. I may also emphasize adding some vegetarian items to your menu considering the interest of people.",
        "I am hoping the food quality will improve in future.",
