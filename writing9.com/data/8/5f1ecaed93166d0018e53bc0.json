        "It's undeniable that there days and ages transportation play major role in business and life. With rapid globalisation and insane velocity of life people need various ways of travelling to different destinations. Some citizens give favour to bicycles while others take precedence for cars. But what vehicle has more benefits to people? To my way of thinking both transports are good for travelling under certain conditions.",
        "Bicycles are chosen by humans who cares about their own health. Case in point, an average Ukrainian citizen does not have time and money for visiting a gym.  Nevertheless, cycling provides an opportunity of exercising on the way home without buying a membership from fitness centre. Additionally, this person gains not only exercises, but he also does not spend money for gasoline. Besides, this kind of vehicle is chosen by youth to reduce the amount of air pollution and to save the environment. Consequently, riding a bicycle has benefits to our bodies as well as to out nature.",
        "Although, there are some circumstances, which do not let us cycling. People use cars on these occasions. This kind of transport is pretty fast, so that it allows people to have a trip on a long distance. For example, Dnipro is a fairly large city and it takes almost two days to travel from one side to another. However if you drive by car or by bus, then it takes no more than three hours to arrive at your destination. Moreover, having a trip  by car is safer and more convenient during the bad weather. For instance, cycling under the rain is not the best option for human health. As a result, driving by a car is beneficial for long distances and bad weather conditions.",
        "To sum up, though so many people, so many minds, in my view both ways of transportation have their benefits. The choice of vehicle depends on a trip and circumstances."
