Last year, I visited it and witnessed the exciting activities which were going on over there. One of the best things I enjoyed a lot, is the variety of food stalls and different rides. Moreover, despite the difficult task to handle a large crowd of people, I found a great ambience and the maintenance and cleaning of the place were up to the mark.",
