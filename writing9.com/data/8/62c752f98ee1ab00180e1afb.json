        "Music indeed plays a vital role in our country, from the eclectic dangdut to the softness of jazz with saxophone. Hence, it has influenced, inspired, and developed a lot of new ideas regardless they had a connection with music or not. Therefore, I agree that music plays a vital role culturally in our country.",
        "Firstly, music is one of several ways to express our ideas and feeling. It lifts our spirit and eases our minds either with complex or simple melodies and arrangements. Additionally, it can bring people together who agreed with the lyrics as well. For example, Iwan Fals's music sounds simple from the melodies, it can be sung only with an acoustic guitar. But because of the sharp and heartfelt lyrics that criticize the government, it become another kind of voice from the oppressed people in the new order era.",
        "Moreover, from a cultural aspect, it can also signify the development of language, international relations, and instrument making. Another example of that is dangdut, the type of music that spread through the Malaka coast, from Malaysia to Singapura. Some believed that it originally came from India, but it got changed and arranged so much, that it lose its origin aspect and thus become another original genre of Malay music. It also had a huge selection of instruments, from the traditional kendang to the modern synthesizer which can be used to suit the mood of the song or represent the new kind of dangdut.",
        "In conclusion, music indeed plays a vital role in our country from expressing ideas and feeling to becoming an important cultural aspect that needed to be recorded and taken note from."
