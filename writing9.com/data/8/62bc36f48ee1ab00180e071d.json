        "Nowadays, it's firmly believed that there are a number of social issues related to youngsters owning to lack of interaction with their parents. From my point of view, I completely agree with this statement. In this essay, I will clarify my view clearly.",
        "To begin with , It's undeniable that there is a remarkable increase in the number of working parents making a bundle thanks to the result of inflation. This situation prevents those parents from paying attention to their children which allows the children to have more freedom. The first problem relating to this is phishing. As the modernisation is occurring extremely rapidly, children nowadays could easily access  digital devices such as: personal computers, mobile phones or tablets, and this permits criminals to attack these teenagers through the internet in order to steal a large amount of cash, especially when there is no censorship from their parents. Take the USA for instance, This country has a proportion of over 60% of teenagers who are the ideal targets of fraud through social media like Facebook or Twitter. As expected, most of them have parents who work roughly 14 hours per day and hardly stay at home. Indeed, this example has demonstrated the problem of fraud related to young people.",
        "Furthermore, a lack of control from the parents over their infants could allow drugs to be available for those guys, even for ones who are still studying at secondary school. This problem is raised for two major reasons. The first cause is children nowadays have more money than those in the past, so they could afford to purchase expensive drugs. The second one is that there are more sources to get drugs both traditional and online sources. Deep web, for example, is a very famous place to trade drugs online. Although the web is hidden, teenagers could get access to it through some simple techniques which can be learned from a variety of videos on the internet.",
        "In conclusion, It's apparent that the rise of working parents has resulted in plenty of social problems that youngsters have to cope with, among ,them phishing and drugs are two of the most outstanding ones."
