Therefore, it would give them opportunities to contribute positively to the success of the community due to the knowledge and experience gained  from their profession.",
        "On the other hand ,it also considered by many that more period of the moment should be allotted to the family members and folks and I agree.  We people believe that family and ally are the only ones that help during  any  crisis and they can also help to improved  work outcomes.

For example,many studies have shown that people that spend more time with their families and friends contribute more positively to the growth of  their profession. Also, spending time with  families gives them opportunities to know when things are wrong physically and mentally  . Therefore, spending time with them would give them opportunities to render care when need it to be.",
