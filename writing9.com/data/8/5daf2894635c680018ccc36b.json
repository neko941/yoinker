        "I am writing to invite you for my eighteenth birthday bash on 20th November, this year.  As this is the end of my teenage years, my parents are throwing a party for all my close friends at our farm house in Riverdale. They have particularly asked me to send you a special invite for the occasion, considering we have become such good pen pals.",
        "Your visit will mean the world to me because it\u2019s been five years since we have been planning to meet. Whenever I go to the park nearby, it reminds me of our chat sessions about cycling. The area is beautiful and I would enjoy going on a ride with you. I know you have been busy with school assignments and it\u2019s difficult for you to make time, however, your presence will enliven the gathering.",
        "I would love for you to stay at my place during this trip. If possible, come over for a week or two and we can explore the forest trail nearby, after the celebration. I will also treat you to my grandmother\u2019s culinary expertise.",
        "I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.",
