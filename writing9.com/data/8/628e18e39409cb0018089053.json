        "Nowadays, some people have a negative idea about libraries because they believe that people do not have time to spend on library resources, whereas they think that hardware such as computers can be used to do the same function. This essay will discuss both these points and as an individual, I strongly disagree with the idea of using computers to share knowledge instead of libraries.",
        "First of all, the words \"silence and knowledge\" originated with the arrival of the libraries, calm and quiet nature of the library supports the  peaceful minds of readers  to absorb the knowledge from the books which are placed in a library. Secondly, libraries are not limited to a particular subject or field, but it contains resources of different streams and subjects, so spending money and resources on building and maintaining such a wonderful place will improve the educational field in any region. Furthermore, private or public libraries have provided a plethora of career opportunities such as bookkeepers, helpers, cleaners, librarians etc.., which give them financial support to run their lives.",
        "But,with the growth and development of the modern world, our young generation has given more priority to information technology devices such as computers and laptops. Though it seems really effective, it has many more consequences on  the human body. Seating in front  of a computer for long period can cause severe damage to the eyes, not only the eyes but also the other parts of the body, including the brain can be affected. So computer libraries can be a pressuring issue for the youngsters and other people. And also in some countries, people do not have the financial stability to spend on computer libraries, this can be a negative point  in the field of education.  Because since  the ancient time, education depends on \"reading books\", but this controversial introduction of computer libraries can become a great impact on the society.",
        "To sum up, libraries are a source of education in any region of the world, so it is the duty of all nations to maintain libraries for the sake of quality education."
