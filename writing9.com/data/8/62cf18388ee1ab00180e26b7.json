        "Dear Mr Ahmed,",
        "I am writing this letter to express my concern about the suitability of my living place for you.",
        "I wanted to bring in your knowledge that I am about to change my residence and move to Lahore next month as I am going to resign from my job. The reason behind that is that my family is in Lahore and my father has his own factory therefore, I have decided to join and support him to run the business.",
        "The house, where I live, is built in a large area and has three bedrooms with a huge lounge. It is newly painted, fully furnished and well-equipped with contemporary design and furniture. Moreover, it is situated in an enclosed society, the roads are too wide and it is facing the park as well. Also, there is an interrupted water supply for 24 hours and security is up to the mark.",
        "I know you have gotten a new job in Pakistan and will be arriving here soon. Therefore, you need to keep your budget low and I think this place is the best fit for you because you can get it at cheaper prices as compared to the other ones. Furthermore, it has a large garage in it so, you do not need to bother to park your car.",
        "I look forward to your kind consideration.",
        "yours sincerely,",
