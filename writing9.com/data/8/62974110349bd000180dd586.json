Others believe the money should be spent on improving existing public transport. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.",

        "With the highly rising rental price and annoying traffic congestion, more and more people prefer to live in the countryside which is far from the main city, thus public transport becomes essential to most people. In this case, some people consider spending plenty of money on constructing new railway lines for fast trains is necessary between cities, while some people think that it is preferable to spend on improving existing transportation. I opine with the latter view.",
        "Thanks to the advancement in technology and construction, now it is much easier and faster to build up a whole new railway than in the past. Moreover, the new railway must be significantly faster than the old one, thus benefiting commuters. For instance, the new line of the Mass Rapid Transit constructed several years ago in Taipei is praised by the public for its comfortable interior and fast speed. However, it may let to the cutting down of forests to allow for the expansion of transportation, which makes the ecosystem even worse.",
        "Obviously, improving the existing public transport is not only more economical and also safer than building one, since it does not need to take time to find a place suitable for new railway lines. Although the existing one may be getting aged, it can be easily upgraded by changing its container and engine. For example, according to the feedback of commuters, the bus became much more comfortable than previous after enhancing its interior such as seats, lights or the arrangement.",
        "To conclude, spending a lot of money on new railway lines may be helpful to deal with the problem of traffic congestion, but in general, it is economical to improve the existing ones. In this case, spending money on improving the old transportation is more paramount for traffic problems than the new one."
