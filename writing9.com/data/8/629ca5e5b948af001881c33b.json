They are paying me well; The co-workers were good too but after a point, I started feeling I am not able to utilize my potential. Hence, I started giving an interview and luckily I grabbed this opportunity as an Internation travel manager. This job is giving me an opportunity to meet new people from all over the world. Also, my job package includes travelling to a country for 10 days and I will be shooting my travel blogs for my company I found this quite interesting. What do you think?",
