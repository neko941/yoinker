        "Migrating for work has always been a part of civilisation, even more so in our day and age. Most parents move with their young ones thereby sparking the debate of whether this is beneficial for the children or not. In this essay, I will look  firstly at the positives and then highlight the negatives with appropriate examples, even though I am of the belief that the pros outweigh the cons.",
        "First and foremost, family comes first. So moving with the family when one gets work in another country ensures that the family unit remains intact. The children benefit immensely when they are under the care of their biological parents. This is shown by the higher statistics of juvenile delinquency in Zimbabwean teenagers whose parents are abroad than those who are with them. Secondly, the relocation affords them  a larger pool of opportunities in life. Especially, if they are coming from less developed communities.",
        "On the other hand, the whole process can be culturally taxing for them. This will in effect have an impact  on how they blend in and adjust to the new environment. The other challenge is that of being cut off from the extended family. Those who have strong bonds with grandparents, aunts and other relatives will be negatively impacted but with the introduction of social media ,platforms this problem can be minimised  as they can communicate via forms such as video calling.",
        "After looking at both arguments, that of the pros and cons of youngsters being relocated to other countries as their guardians move, I  believe to a large extent that they are better off being with them than being left behind."
