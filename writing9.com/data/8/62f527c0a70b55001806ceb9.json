        "I hope you and your family are in good spirits. I am really sorry that I couldn't write to you any sooner as I was up against a few deadlines at work and it has been hectic for me for the last 3 weeks.",
        "To begin with, I have moved to a different apartment in the same neighbourhood. Mainly because my former apartment had just too many problems to deal with, such as uneven power cuts, parking constraints, and things like that. That being said, my new apartment, which is on 5th street, is  more spacious than the last one and it also offers free internet for a period of 12 months besides imported furniture. I am certain that you would think of investing in property such as this if you would see it for yourself personally.",
        "Considering all the above, I would like to invite you over as it has been a while since we last spoke personally. What's more, my wife, Alison, and I would be more than happy to host you for an evening filled with great food and wine.",
        "I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
