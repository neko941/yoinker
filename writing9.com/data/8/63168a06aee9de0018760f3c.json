        "Travelling is one  of the good sources of entertainment which help to reduce stress and return back to  normal life more effectively. Someone argues that foreign journeys are time-consuming and Cost-effective while some others believe it is a precious time for  teenagers. I  agree with the positive thought  viewpoint. This essay will articulate the notions and will discuss them in the coming paragraph.",
        "On the one side,Every travel provides people to learn something new that they do not know before. For teenagers ,It will help very effectively in their future life. We have to explore new places ,to understand their culture and  traditions and also have to eat some new dishes. For example, Last two years back ,I  had an opportunity to go on a week excursion.As it is a part of my office-related travel. The place I visited is Mangalore, The first time I went there ,  I have  difficulty with their language and they cannot understand my tone also. But within days I caught the language they spoke. This will happen because of the sightseeing. Therefore each move keeps everyone updated and more confident in future",
        "On the other side, Sometimes navigation has some drawbacks . Maybe there is  any delay occur because of some natural disasters or some other reasons. This will leads to  people losing their time and money. For instance, during Last year's annual vacation  my family planned to travel to India .We reached the airport on time  and all the formalities be done .After ,that they announced  that, the flight will be delayed for 3  hours .As a result ,All our scheduled programmes will  be changed and in addition to ,that we have to lose some money for the staycation in the hotel.",
        "To conclude, Group of Individuals believe that, Trip to other country is precious  and some folks argue its time-consume and waste of money. I believed that, It has positive factors and also it always helps to their future   and I completely agree with it."
