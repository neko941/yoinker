As a result, I was too unconscious and I really admire your decision of taking me to your house and calling my parents on an immediate basis. Surely, I could have landed up in much more trouble, if you would have not taken me inside your house.",
        "As a token of gratitude, I and my parents would like to invite you over for dinner this Saturday at 8:00 pm. My mother is a very exceptional chef and will prepare a variety of seafood for the occasion.",
