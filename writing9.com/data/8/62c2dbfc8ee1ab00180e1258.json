        "I'm thrilled by hearing that it has selected me for the HR short course that applied through your college website. As per the instructions, I have already booked my air tickets to be there two days prior to the course commencement date, which is 12th April 2022. And I hope to return within two days after the course finishes.",
        "Since I have no  relation or  immediate contact in England, it would be better if you can provide the details of our accommodation. I would prefer a college hostel to stay during the course, but if there is an issue with facilitating such, it is also fine if you can provide known details of places where I can arrange on my own.",
        "Moreover, can please let me know more information about what are the facilities that we are entitled to have during the classes? Such as using the library, meals,  access to the computer lab, etc. In addition, what about the booklet that we are getting from the tutor during our lectures? Is it included  guidelines for the test that we need to sit for after finishing the program?",
