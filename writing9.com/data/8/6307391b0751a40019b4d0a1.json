        "A highly controversial issue today relates to whether the most effective way to deal with health improvement is to build more sports facilities. However, others believe that the more recreation venues are provided, the more public health is improved. In this essay, I am going to examine both points of view and then give my own opinion on the matter.",
        "To commence with, having more sports equipment in the city would encourage more people to exercise frequently and therefore a healthier lifestyle can be ensured. In fact, due to extreme workload and busy schedules, individuals tend to neglect their basic fitness, resulting in deterioration of their well-being. This can be managed if the establishments are available locally and accessible offering convenience. So it is necessary for people to take advanced by dedicating their time towards fitness improvement. Several nations, for instance, have started initiatives to spend a considerable part of their funds on this particular aspect aiming toward a healthier world.",
        "Conversely, others claim that there are several other methods that can be taken to tackle this problem without necessarily increasing athletics centers. With this in mind, the government should come up with policies to encourage people to have a suitable diet. Dieting is a very important aspect of energy that should be taken seriously. For example, a folk who is properly aware of the pros and cons of the food his or her body consumes will always be in good shape. Thus, health campaigns on diet would promote public well-being.",
        "In conclusion, I believe both arguments have their merits. On balance, however, I feel that increasing sports facilities have more advance than other measures. It is hard to stay healthy if you don't exercise regularly. Right?"
