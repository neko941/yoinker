        "I have recently attended a business conference at your hotel 'Rosewood London' and regrettably misplaced some important documents in the room I stayed in. I am hoping you would be kind enough to give me a call once you have it.",
        "I stayed in your hotel from 24th to 25th October in room 524 and attended a conference at the Business Meeting Hall on 24th October. I departed the next day and just after I reached Manchester, I noticed that I have left those documents unattended in my hotel room, perhaps inside the drawer that was placed beside my bed. All of those documents are placed inside a blue folder with my name \u2018Mike Buchanan\u2019 written on top of it.",
        "In particular, these documents are extremely important to me. They contain some confidential financial information about my company, a presentation and some notes that I took during the conference. Without those documents, I would be in great trouble. I need to submit a few of these papers to my company before the end of this month.",
        "I would request you to ask your staff to conduct a thorough search in the room and then hold this folder in your possession. Please give me a call at 0161-508745124578 once you have it. I will arrange someone to collect it for me or perhaps fly to London to receive it personally.",
