        "Currently, an increasing number of people prefer to use a keyboard for their tasks rather than using a pen or a pencil. This essay will discuss both views and argue in the favour of the former.",
        "Firstly, as the world is developing at a fast pace, there is no doubt that technological devices, like keyboards, have made our lives become more convenient. It is human nature to choose what can help them get their tasks done easier and faster.  For instance, in most careers such as corporate employees, typing can get the assigned jobs like reports done neatly with minimal errors as people can always look back and fix their writings. In this way, they can then proceed on another task as using keyboards is time-efficient. Hence, more and more people are opting to type than actual writing.",
        "On the contrary, the traditional way of writing by using a pen or a pencil is still preferred and necessary for certain tasks.\u00a0Since pens and pencils are sold at a very low price, they can be cost-efficient for various working groups and still get the task done quickly. For example, small food stalls may not have an electronic device to write down orders but they can use a pen or pencil to do that which still performs the job perfectly. Thus, for some people, this can be  easier and more convenient for them.",
        "In my opinion, using a keyboard to do assignments can assist to get the work done quickly and more time can be allocated to get other work done. I personally do not have very good handwriting, using the alternative device can help me convey my thoughts more effectively. For instance, when I have to write my thesis for graduate, writing 20 pages can be time-consuming. With the use of a keyboard, I can get it done faster as well as rearrange my ideas.",
        "In conclusion, more and more people choose to use keyboards to perform their assignments instead of using the traditional way of handwriting. I personally agree with this as it will ultimately allow humans to use their time efficiently in getting something done."
