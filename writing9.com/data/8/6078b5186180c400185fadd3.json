        "Diverse nations are betting on  industrial development to ameliorate the quality of life of their citizens, even if it may represent social losses. In my view, despite the essentiality of economic growth, the benefits do does not overcome its disadvantages.",
        "Common sense usually ties a good standard of living to the access of services and amenities, such as a brand-new car or the current fashion season wardrobe collection. By using the \u201cindustrial development\u201d argument, multiple national governments usually grant benefits (e.g., tax cuts, low-interest loans) to large and powerful corporations in order to create new jobs, as well, as to provide goods and services to their population. One example is Ford Motors, an American multinational automaker company, which was almost paid to settle in the State of Bahia in the early 2000s. It had indeed generated a few thousand jobs, and somewhat moved the economy of the cities surrounding the factory.",
        "On the other hand, we notice not only the weakening of social-related policies and values, but also the disregard for constitutional rights, such as a good education, satisfactory public health care, and even sanitation. Furthermore, we have been witnessing  plenty of reforms over the years. Among them, we may stress the changes on the retirement rules, which usually increase years to retire and decrease the amount of money paid. Another example is the flexibility of labour legislation, commonly allowing  employers to easily dismiss workers.",
        "In nutshell, it is undeniable that a strong economy is imperative to any country and important to maintain social services viably. However, what is seen worldwide is an unbalanced proportion of assistance for both citizens and companies."
