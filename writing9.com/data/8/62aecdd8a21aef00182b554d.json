This is going to be  2 years of study program which includes an internship in the last semester. I have never been to Toronto, so looking forward to getting the details from you about the city",

Hence any temporary work will help me to cover my living expenses. I am aware that you have a great friend circle there. So I would be so thankful if you can recommend me to your known ones.",
        "I have good knowledge and experience in computers. So any assistant level jobs will be more suitable. However, I am open to taking any job and I will do my best to succeed in that.",
