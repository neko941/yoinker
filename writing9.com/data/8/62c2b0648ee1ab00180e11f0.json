The equipment is now working intermediate, in other words, the lights flash green and orange. It connects my wifi to the internet sometimes but does not work at the other time.",
        "The problem affects my job a lot.  As I am working at home now, all my documents relative to my job need to be uploaded to my corporation host system, and I need to cooperate with my colleagues. If the router does not work, I couldn't surf the internet, and I can't communicate with my team, which can put me in a cliff situation, thus making me be fired by the boss. In order to fit the problem that suffers me much, I need your company to send a technician to my home to check the router and repair it or let someone send me a new router to replace my old one.",
