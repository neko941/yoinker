        "Undoubtedly, information is a crucial resource in the modern world. Moreover, it is so precious that certain people call it a \u00abnew currency\u00bb. Needless to say, data is vital for emerging and existing technology. So, if reliable and credible information was not shared with scientists and experts it would not be possible for mankind to develop in the right direction. However, certain individuals whose main priority is making money may well use the shared data to cause harm to innocent people.",
        "Some people hold the view that it is essential to give information so that it might be used in different scientific studies and the corporate world. On the ground that, data is a cornerstone of ultra-modern and developing technology. Subsequently, it is not possible to make human lives easier without evolving technology. Therefore, I am inclined to agree with this opinion because humans have been making huge progress in such fields as health care and education. Consequently, it is vital this trend will continue. To illustrate, it has become possible to perform microsurgery by robots in certain hospitals. Thanks to shared data that enabled AI professionals to design robots working alongside doctors and performing tasks which are extremely difficult for surgeons to complete.",
        "Several people think that some data is too priceless to spread. Since it might be used by technological corporations or some indecorous scientists to harm ordinary individuals. From my perspective, it may well be the case. For example, according to a study, a famous social media (some might say infamous) called Facebook may be detrimental to mental health due to used algorithms which are designed to make users addicted to the content they consume. So, with more and more personal data available this situation might get worse.",
        "To summarise, it is a controversial topic whether any information should be freely shared with experts and researchers. Considering that some unprincipled businessmen may use it to harm individuals, it might be better not to share it . However, if data is not divided it will lead to a technological crisis and a decline in the quality of life level."
