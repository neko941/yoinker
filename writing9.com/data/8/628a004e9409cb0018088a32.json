Furthermore, the die heart fans of stardom would try to copycat them and they consider  their role models.For instance, nowadays,it is common among the population  that they mimic the activities of superstars for publishing in media to get the attraction of other people and sometimes they destroy their hearts and blame those renowned personalities.",
        "However, despite these facts ,we cannot neglect the benefits of becoming famous.Firstly they are easily recognised by society and could get consideration  everywhere.For example, if one popular person would like to purchase something ,the owners will provide the best offers.Another thing,they can attain love and respect across the world.Again ,they are able to lead a luxurious life and social status by achieving good financial stability.The families of these successful people also achieve a successful life.These factors could not be negotiated.",
        "To sum up,although there are many  profits in getting rich and popular ,one cannot keen into the disadvantages in it."
