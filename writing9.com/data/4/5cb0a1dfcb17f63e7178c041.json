        "Learning the foreign language at primary school as compared to higher school is adviced by few knowlegable people.Like everything it also have some pros and cons in my opinion, advantages are more in qauntity than disadvantage.",
        "Looking at positive side, the students will be more developed intelligently, intellectualyy and socially.",
        "We know a child's brain can be easily molded in any directions, so if we can easily  make him to study other languages  without any trouble. For example, when we teach a child english, that is  totally different what he is hears at home,  a less effort is made as compared to elders. in the same way we can teach them various languages and can remember for his life.",
        "By learning it, he can go for higher studies outside his country without learning there language. Like if he wishes to do his graduation in Germany its obligatory to learn and give exam in their native language. Even can apply for various job in different countries and chances of promoyion also get increased. For instance, if there are two candidates for single post belong to same countries head of the company will prefer him as compare to other as less effort has to be made to make him understand.",
        "Friend circles will automatically get increaded because understanding between them will be good, by conveying each others emotions perfectly.",
        "Observing nagative, the students in higher schools already have so many subjects to learn so it becomes hectic for them to learn extra subject. Like already said for outside education language has to be learned which is difficult at this stage as brain can not cop up with this pressure also.",
        "In conclusion, noticing above two condition its clear merits weighted more than demerits. So better to start teaching it at lower classes than higher one."
