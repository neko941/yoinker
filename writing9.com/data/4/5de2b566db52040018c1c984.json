        "Recent trends show that our environment is degrading every now and then. Although, some people believe that it should be rectified within the nation, I support the notion that it should be resolved globally, as new techniques and steps can be incorporated for proper resolvement",
        "On the one hand, the solution what local bodies or Government can provide will be outdated, as they use traditional techniques for the same. As a result, the problem will persists even if we implement those ideas effectively.  Apart from this, officials and bureaucrats will try to loot the local peoples' revenue as happened with Ernakulam bridge building issue, where muncipality officers had biased their decision in exchange of some money. Thus, a proper solution will be outnumbered by the aforementioned reasons, if we rely on local bodies.",
        "On the other hand, if the problems pertaining with our surroundings are brought up internationally, we   could incur more attraction  towards the problem. This in turn helps in finding more viable and technologically sound solutions. Moreover, these initiatives can be implemented without any hurdle because they are well-planned and requires less manpower. For instance, the Environmental Authority of The United Arab Emirates adopts  their lawn laying process from Norway,hence they accomplish their target without any difficulties for the locals. Hence, global solution should be incorporated in solving ecosystem problems",
        "In conclusion, I opine to the fact that environmental issues should be addressed globally, which can help in finding a proper and organised solution for the cause."
