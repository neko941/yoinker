        "Nowadays,  we are witness how fast growth of numerous industries. Recruiting the best candidate  is very difficult  for many employers.  How they can determinate this person is best fit for this job?  Some people says  education, certificate and experience is more important than  personal qualities. I think both of these components  are  important.",
        "At the outset, there are numerous  reasons why both of these components are important  but the most conspicuous one lies in the fact that  if people will have great education and experience  but not will have   social skills how will be looking relation between them and potential clients ?  How will be looking relation with other  team members  when will be time to work together . Determination, discipline, comunication skills are important to full  team success.",
        "To explain another view I can use an example  job  like pilot. For pilot  is necessary to have experience, education and also have personal qualities . Personal qualities are important  when they have contact with passengers and other  team members, but when is some emergency situation personal qualities isn't enough.  That time,   most important is education about how airplane  works, how looks procedure when is emergency situation and big pilot experience.",
        "In summary, both components are important depends of jobs  . For cardiochirurg more important is experience, for makeup maker and pilot experience and social skills are important."
