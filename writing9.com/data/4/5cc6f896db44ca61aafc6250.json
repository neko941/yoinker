        "\u2022\tThere is increasing awareness in the cleanness and tidiness of an area, however, some individuals believe that is the responsibility of residents to keep their environment clean and tidy, while others think it is the responsibility of the government. In this essay, I will discuss both views and give my own opinion.",
        "On the one hand, the area individuals reside needs to be kept clean and tidy by the people to enable them to live healthily, free of disease. It is common saying cleanliness is next to godliness.",
        "Also, people need to arrange and sort their waste properly, so as to avoid a domestic accident with an untidy environment. For example, children having injuries on their legs or hands where dangerous household utensils like knives are not properly kept away from them.",
        "Furthermore, it is the responsibility of citizens to maintain their immediate surrounding, like using cutlass to cut tthe grass, when it is overgrown such, will reduced reptiles and rodents in the area thereby making the environment clean and tidy.",
        "On the other hand, the government plays a major role in the cleanness and tidiness of the area where citizens reside.",
        "Firstly, the government needs to hire the services of a waste management company, they will help to transfer waste generated at homes for proper disposer. Although this also helps to generate incomes for government, which they can use to fixed street light and maintain those areas. For instance, the lagos state government has the services of LAWMAN, which has help to clean lagos.",
        "In conclusion, I think individuals and government both have important roles to maintain clean and tidy areas where citizens reside. This help to provide healthy people and also a source of revenue for the government."
