        "The maps illustrate the substantial modifications in the landscape and the development that had taken place at the seaside town, called Portview, between 1990 and 2010.",
        "Overall, it can be clearly seen that during the 20 years, Portview was totally transformed.",
        "To begin with the town in 1990, Portview had very few facilities and structures. The main road was set up to the center of the town from the north to the south, and there were two local roads constructed to link the main street. A shopping mall and a minimal resort were built to the west of town. Additionally, there was a huge farm surrounded by two places for doing outdoor activities which are playing golf and swimming. Turning to the east of the town, some stores were constructed. Surprisingly, there was only one pier located beside the sea.",
        "Moving on to the seaside town in 2010, considerable changes were clearly observed. To the west of town, the farmland was demolished and replaced with park area same as the small resort was replaced with many hotel buildings. The golf course and the swimming place were developed as well as the department store. A footpath connecting the mainline road leads to the swimming area through the new park, so citizens can take some rest in the park. To the east of the town, A new car park was placed to the north. Moreover, the coffee shop was resized, and some shops and pier were expanded."
