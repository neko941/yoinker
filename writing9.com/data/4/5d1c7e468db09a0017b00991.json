        "In 1988, Britain was the first country were cars appeared. By 2000, the number of vehicles on British roads increased to about 29 million. Many people believe that international laws and forms of transportation should be binded by the goverment to the community. This essay will discuss why those rules are important to put.",
        "First of all, some people do not care for other people's lives, they drive without taking care as if there is no one else in the street. This leads to many accidents and killing people, if there were no laws and punishments for these people, no one will care and drive carefully.",
        "As well as, boys do not think wisely, rules should be put for youths to drive in a better way in order not to harm themselves nor the people around them. If the goverment did not bind those teenagers , especially whose age is under 18 years, to follow the forms the percentage of death caused by accidents will increase.",
        "But some laws are not logic or they just concentrate on them more than any other laws that may be more important and safer for the driver. One of these laws is that kids are forbiden to sit on the front seat , but that does not make any sense if the kid was wearing the seat belt it will be safe just as sitting on the back seat.",
        "At the end of this essay, I just want to ask every driver to take care while he/she is driving, wear the seat belt, and do not use your phone instead concentrate on the street and cars around you. Many parents are waiting their kids, if you cannot be responsible while driving then do not drive because people souls are valuable."
