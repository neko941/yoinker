        "Being a part of NGO, making good connections with the neighbours or provide sports education to youngesters should be mandatory according to few people. In my opinion, it will be trimendous act for the development of student spritually and intelligently, that will have positive effect on a country as a whole.",
        "Firstly, students will be more sensitive rather kind towards helpong people around them, which is lagging somewhere nowadays, by getting involed in it. For example by paying visit to orphanage  or oldage homes, which nowadays getting increased in number as children do not have enough time for their parents. It make them feel satisfied by spending enough time or bringing some gifts for them. Not only humans then also care about animals also.",
        "Secondly, younsters  are having more interaction with neighbours, relatives etc, that is quite invisible in students maybe because of social media or games. They pay more visit inorder to help them in various household things or to talk with them and going with their parents to meet relatives.",
        "Finally, it can encourage young blood to provide free education tp younger generation of any caste or creed ( poor, rich or orphans)  by sharing information about the subject like sports, arts, history etc. For instance, they can go to any stadium to teach any particular sports in which he is expert.",
        "In conclusion, any country having these gems will automatically prosper amd this type of education can be better given in school only."
