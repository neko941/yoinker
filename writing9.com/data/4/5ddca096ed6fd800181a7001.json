        "Now a days children doesnot have much home work when compared with the old generations where atleast they used to have more than one homework per day. There are many debates around this where few say yes and others saying no. In this essay we will discuss both sides of the argument with reasons.",
        "As children will be spending most of the daytime in school, will be stressed out by the time they come back home. Also, parents are so busy in their jobs, most of them end up joining the kids in the tutions. In recent times, they are many tutoring centers which are making business out this. So, many people argue that this schedule of going to the tutions after school is very tiring for students. Childhood is the time where playing is also quite equally important as studies and as they are spending much time with books in schools.",
        "Taking the other side of the argument, school syllabus now a days is quite touch and there is a lot of competitive spirit between the students in getting their best grades. In order to compete with all this it is always better to have some school related work to be repeated at home, so that it can be revised. Parents also can guide the kids in getting the things more clear and have an idea of how they are doing at academic level. In recent times, the kind of homeworks the teachers give has been changed. The project work they do are more activity oriented and children will gain practical knowledge. All these things enhance the level of education and improves they way of thinking and pave path for better education.",
        "To conclude, eventhough they are both sides of arguments in giving homework to pupils, the important thing is the type of homework they should give plays an vital role in improving the education of the todays school students. They should be given with minimal work and more practical kind a work where they enjoy doing it instead of feeling it as an extra stress."
