        "Some  argue  that a small  number  of  younger  people  in  several  nations  watch  news on  TV  or  read  newspapers.  The  reason  for  that  is  that  they  use  different  means  to follow  the  news  and  therefore,  should  have  the  news  delivered  to  them  through devices they are using on a daily basis.Younger people do not tend to readnewspapers or watch TV since they have grownup using other items rather than TV or newspapersto follow the news or any other events around the world. Firstly, they use computers, their mobile phones and tend to  listen to podcasts  and  radio  in  order  to  follow  the  news.  Secondly,  the  younger people do not wait for particulartimes to sit in front ofthe TV to watch the news as older  people  do,but  instead  want  to  watch  whenever  they  want  from  whatever device they use or carry with them. The  solution  is  to  accommodate  the  younger  people  and  push  the  news  to  their devices  they  use.  So,  theyhave  apps  that  they  can  upload  to  their  phones  and tabletsas well as TVs so that they can follow the news from them. The news should be  recorded  so  that  they  can  choose  to  listen  and  watch  the  news  whenever  they feel like it and is best for them. For example, they are waiting for a bus or a train to get them to schooland they can alsolisten to the recorded news whenever it suits them and wherever they feel like it.The newspapers and TV needs to move to the devices the younger people use and they  need  to  have  thenews  available  at  any  time  with  any  devicefor  the  younger people to access them whenever and whereeve"
