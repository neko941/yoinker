        "Some people believe that the ideal way to inspire and embolden employees to work harder is to give them a pay that is commensurate with how much they have produced or sold. In my opinion, workers will often perform better when they have more than just their salary to look forward to on pay day.",
        "To start With, issuing sales bonus to employees who have put in the effort to increase the products or services sold out in that period, will further motivate them to do better in the coming months, which will in turn help the organisation make more annual profits.",
        "A case in point, is the increase of revenue  generated in my organisation as a Business Development Executive from a #100,000 to #500,000 monthly profit. A 10% of the total amount sold is often given to a sales representative as a bonus  which further motivated me not to relent in achieving much more than #500,000 the next month.",
        "Furthermore, production bonus is also a way of influencing workers not in the sales team, but are in the Factory, Banking and Administrative departments. Consequently, the employee tend to work harder and aim to produce more knowing they will be rewarded tremendously for it asides their normal pay. An example is a situation were as a platform officer in one of the leading banks, my productivity level for the day was graded based on the number of customer issues i resolved for that day. Faced with walk-in individuals who had various attitudes and backgrounds, I constantly stayed motivated by the fact that i will be rewarded with an additional pay per customer issue I effectively handle. To this end, the Bank became well known for adequate customer service and it resulted to a win-win for everyone.",
        "In conclusion, encouraging and motivating employees can come in various forms and ways, but the ultimate achievement will lead to a situation were everyone is happy and satisfied. In my opinion, I strongly recommend and hope all companies around the globe would enact this method of keeping employees inspired."
