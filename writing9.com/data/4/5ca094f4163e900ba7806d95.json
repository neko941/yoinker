        "The emergence of technological advancements, particularly internet, has an extremely pivotal role in revolutionizing our lives and influencing the economies all over the world. Nevertheless, some people are under impression that due to the use of internet, people sooner or later will have the identical thoughts and conduct. I also have the similar point of view which will be discussed in this essay.",
        "To start off, the appearance of internet has eliminated all possible barriers thanks to a specific language encoded by IT specialists for users regardless of occupation, location, interest, and race. People, in real life, were born with various differences with personal peculiarities and traits which distinguish them from the others. However, in internet world, it is obligated for all users to communicate and follow the generally-standardized rules upon the unified parlance. Thus, those who immerse themselves in a web community will",
        "be equal and behave in the identical ways.",
        "In relation to the economic influences, the internet innovation has drastically altered the operations and interactions of the global economy. Most of the companies domestically or overseas can transmit the information through the internet protocol quickly, conveniently, and inexpensively or even change the payment platforms to conduct the payments easily. Therefore, it will produce significant cost savings in many sectors of the economy which result in the fast productivity growth as a whole.",
        "For these reasons, I\u2019m inclined to believe that Internet, no matter what benefits it could bring to our lives, erases all boundaries and distinctions. People tend to lose their features and move forward to the web society whilst using the internet."
