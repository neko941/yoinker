        "Today's world has been devided into developing and industrialised countries which the main difference between them is the amount of money that government apply in important sectors such as education,health and commerce. Most of the poorer nations are buried in depts as a resultof their unbalanced finances which are reflect in a failed health carean unstructured education system and weak international trade. This viciouscycle will continue indefinitely unless weathier nations show interest in minimizing the worldwide economic differences,as well as taking more responsibility for assisting less fortunate countries.",
        "Most of the African countries live in sub-human conditions because of the extreme poverty,upheaval,hunger,disease,unemployment,lack of education and both inexperienced and corrupt administrations.The devastationg consequences of the AIDS epidemic in those countries could improve  if the infected population were to recive free drugs to control the disease,have access to health professionals and get information on how to prevent its spread.But this can only be achived through international help programs in which leaders of the world's richest countries donate medicine and also send and nurses to treat and educate those in need.",
        "Moreover,most of the poor countries rely on selling agriculture products and raw materials to rich nations and buying industrialized products from them resulting in a huge financial deficit.Consequently,they borrow a significant amount of money from the World Bank to try to improve their broken economies, but sometomes the money disappears with no significant changes and they cannot even pay the interest to the bank,decided to forgive billions of dollars' worth if dept owed by the world's poorest nations.Inaddition,they developed adequate loan programs to financially assist those countries.",
        "In conclusion,leaders of the industrialised countries play an indispensable role in assisting developing nations in dealing with essentail areas such as health,education and trade.Also,their aid is the key to breaking the vicious cycle,which results in poverty and death."
