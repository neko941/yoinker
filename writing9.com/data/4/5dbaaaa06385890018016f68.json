        "In the recent years, there has been drastic rise in the number of students taking up technology related courses at unversities. There are people who believe that students should only focus on courses related to technology as it would help them with their career. However, there are others who believe its important for students to pick up courses based on their interest areas. This eassy will discuss both sides of the argument and put forth my points supporting  the latter view.",
        "Technological advancements in the recent years have given rise to various new branches in science. AI, blockchain, nanotechnology etc. are some of the new areas were there is a huge demand for highly skilled workers. There is  also a widespread belief that, compensation for jobs in the technology sector are much better compared to other white collar jobs. This has resulted in a situation, were students are picking up technical courses rather than focusing on their interest areas.",
        "It is a well know fact that, out of the three hundred thousand engineers who passout each year from engineering colleges in india, only 10% is employable. This is predominantly beacause many of our students take up engineering as a course, due to pressure from parents or in hopes of getting a lucritive job. But there is a shift in this mentality, students nowadays have a clear idea about the career they want to persue and are only taking up courses which of their interest.",
        "In conclusion, I believe its important that, we educate our student on various career option and let them decide the courses they want to take up at the University"
