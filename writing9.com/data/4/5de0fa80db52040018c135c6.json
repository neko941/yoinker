        "due to the fact that environmental problems are controversial,there are plenty of reasons given by people and researchers on it,in this essay we are going to expand an argue on this topic.",
        "some people strongly believe in the fact that the more we lose particular species the more planet earth is in jeopardy.some species are in danger of extinction however their existence has a direct effect on environmental problems.",
        "we,mankind ,are responsible for this loss of species due to the unparalleled haunting ever than before and the global warming which is growing heavily each year because of human beings.",
        "some may disagree,giving reasonable proofs of what they are claiming.",
        "they may talk about recycling and unacceptable use of energy and plastic.they are not on the same page with the first group about global warming,they believe that it is a natural phenomenon based on climate changing and it is not controllable by people.",
        "As both groups support their claiming by logical and scientific statistics,It is hard to distinguish which causes lead us to be living on a planet with extremely high environmental problems.but to talk rationally,there is no right or wrong side to take on this issue.there are possible reasons to this problem as much as there are human on the earth.in my point of view,we, human beings, are the most cruel enemy the planet earth could have ever imagined of and we can't blame it on climate changing or many other natural phenomenon.",
        "the loss of species may not be the main reason leading to environmental problems, but it can be an important one and we should not turn a blind eye to it."
