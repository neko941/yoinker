        "While it is believed by many that TV programme, friendship and song are the major elements impact on the development of a child in today's life, others think that parents obviously play the most important role in their offspring growth. This essay will examine both sides before declaring a preference.",
        "On the one side, there is no doubt that there are many factors external to family that significantly influence children as he gets older. Televisions and the Internet, for instance, can be considered to be some of those things. Youngsters nowadays have access to these much more than those in the past, who only could get information through radios or books. In addtion, friends also have a major effect as children incline to mimic their sheers who they are admire or respect. This can be positve behaviour, nevertheless, it can be negative such as smoking or taking drugs. On the other hand, i believe that family members have the most important impact. As juvelniles spend nearly most of their time with their family, especially in their early years, they easily being affected by their parents' actions and words. The proof of this can be seen in the differences between some children in the same class and watching the same TV shows. Those that grow up in a warm and close environment would achieve more confidence and security in adult life, whilst those are brought up in dysfunctional homes often eventually have strange behaviour and have problems with themselves.",
        "In conclusion, although social factors play a part in influencing a child' development, I believe that it is family that can provide a supportive, secure and nurturing environment, which is crucial to the way that a child becomes an adult."
