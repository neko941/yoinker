        "Nowadays, accommodation is one of the most debatable issues that faces a wide range of people all over the world. Despite the many positive sides of living in a private house,large number of people prefer to live in an apartment with fewer facilities and affordable price.",
        "First of all,living in a house gives people the privacy they need. The house is usually quiet distant from the other near houses. Therefore, people can live freely and they will have the ability to do whatever they need in their own property.",
        "For instance, if they want to make a big party,they will listen to loud music. Furthermore, living in a house is more suitable for extended families who want to live together. The house is wide, as well as it consists of its own garden and its own garage. At the time of feasts, when all the members of the family all gathering together sharing some special food or celebrates some special events. Does a big house or a flat in an apartment suits these kinds of celebrations?",
        "Conversely, some people see that living in a small flat is more affordable. As buying a house costs a huge fortune. As a result of that, most of the ordinary people who are getting an ordinary salary by the end of the month are likely to live in apartments. People with high wages are the ones living in big houses. Another things to be added,apartments are more practical than houses. Most of the big cities which are overcrowded with people, consists of large number of apartments rather than houses. There are no place for big houses. The skyscrapers and the big apartments contains hundreds of families as each floor may have more than five flats. Cairo, for example, is crowded with people and contains millions of apartments everywhere.",
        "At the end, every thing in the world has its pros and cons. I see that the advantages of living in a house outweigh the disadvantages. However, every person must be aware about his own circumstances and finances. He definetly knows what is the best option for him and his family."
