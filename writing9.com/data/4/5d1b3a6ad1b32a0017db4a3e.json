        "Many college students leave their home and their family to go to study far away form their hometown. I think it is a right choice because let them to grow and confront with new realities. But move is not always easy, sometimes live alone is difficult and many families can not afford a rental house in big cities so students have to decide to go to study near home to avoid other expenses.",
        "Nowadays almost all colleges students leave their family house to continue their studies faraway from home. In my opinion, is an important choice, because they will face an important experience that will let them develop personal aspects and knowing other students with different backgrounds. Colleges are different, in many countries they are provided of dormitory or little apartments where students can live with other roommates. The cost of the accommodation is included in the price of university taxes. Is the best option for a student, he can live with friends and can concentrates on his duty.",
        "A dormitory there is not always. To give an example, in Italy, my nation, universities are differents, they are almost all public institutions and university taxes supply barely at the studies. Students have to find an accommodation by themselves, many times to afford the cost  of a rental house in a big city they have to find a job. Working during the studies makes difficult pay the right attention on lessons and exams. Besides there are some youths who have to stay at home with families because taxes are too expensive.",
        "According to me, the study is a right for everyone so governments and colleges have to help everyone to supply the istruction. All universities should have a dormitory or apartments for their students. Living faraway from home is an important step for life."
