        "The rate of crime is expanding in most of the world, and it is getting to be more harmful. There are several reasons for committing the crime, but in my opinion, two main arguments are causing to make people do illegal actions. They are unemployment and low salary.",
        "The people who have no money sometimes commit the crime due to survive or encourage their family. For example, if one of the family members is ill and the family extremely needs money, but no one wants to help, in this condition any people can do illegals to help financially. Therefore, the government should provide citizens with work, consequently, they would be able to earn money without any legal problems.",
        "If the employee works hard but does not satisfy with the salary, he or she tries to find out other ways to get money in order to support the family expenditure. So, to avoid such violations, employers should pay the workers their wages corresponding to their labor.",
        "In conclusion, where there is not any unemployed or the worker with a low salary there will not be the people who commit the crime."
