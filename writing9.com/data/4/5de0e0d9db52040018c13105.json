        "Now a days, traditional method of teaching is being replaced by new technology. There are both advantages and disadvantages for the change.",
        "In the past, for students to gain knowledge, they had to go directly for lecture. This sometimes would be difficult for some students thereby missing their classes. On the other hand, with new technology, they can attend the class from anywhere. Secondly, students are able to choose their own time for the lecture. For instance, classes on online sites can be attended at their convenient time which is a huge advantage.",
        "On the contrary, lectures through computers become very redundant thereby making classes very boring. Similarly, students will not be able to get values or make friends if they attend classes from their own places.",
        "In short, both the traditional method and modern technology have their own advantages and disadvantage. Students should select the suitable  method according to their convenience."
