        "The notion that the government ought to provide free education from nursery school to university by financing the education sector is highly debatable partly because of the numerous rationales on both sides of this controversy. I, for one, firmly stand in favour of the aforementioned statement as countless experts in this sunject matter. This essay aims to elaborate the factors that compelled me to support the idea and present the arguments to those on the other side of the idea.",
        "First of all, education is one of the basic needs of the citizens of a country; therefore, it should definitely be free of cost. As people are contributing to the country\u2019s economy by paying taxes, it is a responsibility of the government to ensure that each and every citizen get the equal opportunity to gain knowledge and receive formal education. In Canada, for example, an adult have to pay high rate of income tax; as a result, the canadian government offers free education to the domastic students. Moreover, poverty, one of the major problem in developing and underdeveloped countries, can certainly be reduced if people are made to be educated. In other words, if the government provides free aducation,  poor people will be able to achieve a higher degree, which will help them get a good job with a handsome salary.  As a consequesce, not only the individuals but the country\u2019s economy also will be benefited.",
        "While it is understandable why some would feel inclined to oppose the idea, the reasons behind their reluctance are motivated by sunjective biases. For starter, people will be underestimate the value of education if it is offered free of cost. However, in reality it is untrue. Needless to say,  most,  if not all, scholarly opinions also disprove their opinion on different groups."
