        "The table illustrates how many male and female workers were employed in British and Walsh factories in the years from 1851 to 1901. In general, the amount of male and female labours experienced a downward trend throughout the period, but the account of factories significantly increased with a fluctuating trend.",
        "At the beginning of the period, there was nearly half a million of male (287,100) and female (190,000) employees in 225 factories in England and Wales. In contrast, these figures declined in total, 61,000 at the end of the period, however, the number of factories increased almost three fold to 600.",
        "In 1861, the amount of male workers rate slightly less than females, it was 131,780 males and 160,000 females in 227 factories in the given countries. After a decade, both males (80,123) and females (60,000) less than the previous period, but the rate of factories increased to 622.",
        "In 1881 and 1891, the rate of male employees declined from 76,132 to 65,000 as well as females 50,000 to 40,000 in the factories. In addition, the number of factories in England and Wales also decreased from 722 to 625."
