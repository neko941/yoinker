        "Crime rate is something that has been increasing constantly over the years. One of the many reasons is, more atrocities being carried out by prisoners after finishing their first punishment. I shall discuss different aspects of this in the following paragraphs.",
        "Jails nowadays have become a junction for different crime committers to meet under a single roof. The probability of one getting to know others in such places increases, eventually leading to good socialization among them. So even if someone decides to stop the crimes, it becomes difficult for that individual to come out of the jaws of these gangsters when they are out of the premises and hence they are drawn to more illicit jobs.",
        "Sometimes the offenders are mistreated by officers while serving their sentences, which turns out to have a negative impact on them. They become more vicious and intolerant towards the system. By the time they are out after their first punishment, they are transformed into beasts to take on the same system. Their psychological mindset changes and draws them towards negative shades of the society. These infants of crime also learn new techniques from other subordinates.",
        "In conclusion, one cannot deny the fact that, all first timers of prisons do not end up in doing anti-social activities, but there is a large group of them who can, if they are mistreated and gelled with other inmates. This can be controlled by taking right measure by the government."
