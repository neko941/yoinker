        "In the current scenario, where the economies are blooming at the rapid pace, the crime is also evolving at alarming rate. As, there are umpteen contributing factors that lead to the crime expansion, there are multifarious solutions to this rising issue.",
        "People are inculcating in the illegal activities due to sundry reasons. The primary reason is that the inflation rate is surging up and due to their modest lifestyles, people are not able to cope up with their meager salaries. As a result, they start imbibing themselves into thefts, murder like activities. Another reason is the unemployment. Due to increasing competition in every aspect and the jobs are limited, the individuals are not able to find suitable jobs. There is a saying, \u201can empty mind is devil\u2019s workshop\u201d.  Myriad people are still unemployed even securing high education degrees and for their survival, they start taking part in activities which violates the law of the nation. For instance, the reports have stated the fact that in the developing nation like India, the crime rates are growing as people are unemployed and due to the scarcity of jobs, they don\u2019t able to find employment and the youngsters are indulging into crimes like thefts, rapes, murders etc.",
        "There are a plethora of possible remedies to this muddle. Firstly, if the authorities create more stable jobs in every sector and people will automatically find satisfactory jobs, they will be galvanized to work for the betterment of the nation and as a result, the crime rate will be dwindled. Another solution is that there should be stern actions against any felony, so that, everyone should think twice before committing any misdeed. For example, in counties like  the United Arab emirates, there are strict laws against any crime even if it is minor, so the crime rate is near to 0%.",
        "To encapsulate, it is the prime duty of government to make safe and stable environment for the citizens of their country by providing them good infrastructure, employment opportunities etc."
