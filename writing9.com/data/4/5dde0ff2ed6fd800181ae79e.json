        "One key benefit of the advancement in information technology is the rise in home based jobs. This obviously has some major advantages over the traditional ways of doing job. In this essay we shall discuss the pros and cons of working from home and see whether it is beneficial for the society as a whole or vice versa.",
        "The first and foremost advantage of working from home is the cost saving for both the employer and the employee. The employer saves money by not having to rent office space, furnish it and pay bills, while the employee saves money by not paying for transportation or fuel etc. This cost saving enables the employer to pay better rates per hour to the employee. However, sometimes cost saving is not the main focus of the employer and instead they are looking for better quality of work. A person working from home may sometimes be distracted by thier family which my affect the quality of work produced. Moreover, there is limited interaction with the home based worker which sometimes causes problems.",
        "Another major advantage is for housewives who have small childern to look after, since they cannot leave thier childeren to do a 9 to 5 job, they can easily manage a job they can do at home. This helps them utilise their time in a productive manner and they can contribute toward acheiving a better living standard for thier family. Some people argue, that this trend creates a lot of competition since people around the world compete for limited number of jobs available and it reduces the full time employment.",
        "In conclusion, the advantages of working from home overshadow the disadvantages and this trend has helped many people in earning a decent income that helps them to earn more money sometimes in addition to their regular jobs for their families."
