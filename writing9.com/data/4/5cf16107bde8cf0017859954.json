        "In this present era, majorities of guardians make fewer restrictions as compared to old days and give more exception to their offspring to explore different things and to take a decision on its own.on the one hand allowing their kids to make choices helps them to develop decision-making skills and boost their self-confidence that leads to successful Life, on the other hand, permits their children with excess freedom might cause some threat to both. Despite some negatives, I ponder that outcomes are more positive than drawbacks.",
        "To embark with, firstly, parents give authority to their kids to make a decision on their career perspective. This means adolescents are free to choose the stream in the field of education as well as in a profession according to their own interest, whereas in past, parents do not allow their children to choose any profession and pressurise their offspring to select subjects and job according to them. consequently, having the right to make their choice helps them to enhance their skills on decision making as per their own view and tackle the situation according to them also helps them in future.",
        "Secondly, having liberty along with doing things on its own and making choice in life allows them to broaden their experience and boost their self-confidence drastically. This may lead to a successful profession and increase the joy of happiness in their life because by doing things on its own interest will broaden their horizon and helps them to become more independent . For instance, a survey conducted by Cambridge University found that 80% of international students who decide to study abroad are more successful in achieving their goals and less dependent on their parents.",
        "On the other hand, allowing children to make a decision might cause some serious problem for parents and children. This is illustrated by the fact that these days youngsters are free to make friends and follow the fashion trends and this may be the reason to adapting bad habits from other and for following latest trends they spend excessive amount of money to show off in a friend circle. This is happening because they do not know the difference between right and wrong in this age .hence, they need proper guidance and support from their parents in every stage of life.",
        "To put it succinctly, although there are some negatives of this approach, I believe that learning decision making skills and enhance the  experience of making choice are more beneficial for youngsters to become more independent and successful."
