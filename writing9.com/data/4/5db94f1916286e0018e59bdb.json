        "In this day and age,  young generation is the base of any nation as an effect they having an important role in society, so for their self building individuals said that some chairty work include in high school programmes. I strongly argued that government should take action related unpaid task in community for youngsters.",
        "Firstly, in the age of high school, students need to build their self confidence and get  experience by doing unpaid work. Due to achivieving  confidence they do not relay on parents and doing jobs independently for this governments should starts programs, compaigns and workshops in the school to teach school community. For example, a recent research shown that many countries started programs and unpaid interships  to train the students for their respective a professional fields. By doing this, they can have more exposure to their related fields of work.",
        "secondly, by doing free work in society, it will help to young generation become socially responsible. They will help handicaped people, cleaning the roads of society as well work in old age homes, later on, it will help in professional life. For example, some students stop their education at high school level so, this experience will help getting a job in hospitals as well  factories or as a labour.",
        "In conclusion, i believe that unpaid task in society will be more beneficial for that these programs should be compulsory part of high schools."
