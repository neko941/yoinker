        "Many reaserches have been performed in order to evaluate what affect our personality and character. Some believe inborn traits and genetics play a major role in establishing our behaivor. Others believe that education and social standarts shape who we will become.",
        "With the finding of the DNA and the chromosomal structure, may publications focused on finding the genetic bases of our personality. This was based on previous knowledge that some families have certain traits different from the surrounding enviroment. Examples to that include narcsism, border line, and histerionic personality disorders. Despite social exposure these patients still developed the same personality flaws their parent and siblings had. As a conclusion, inborn traits were reported to be superior to social effects in shaping our personality.",
        "In contrast to the above mentioned, other researches were inspired by psychological inovaitors and began to explore the social effects on our character. These focused mainly on child mother relationship as well as social interaction versus social isolation. These studies have shown, as an example, that social isolation led to a substantially more aggressive behaivor in comparisson to other people.  Another known example, have shown facial reactions of a 1 day baby when looking at he's mother. The facial expression done were similar to mather's expression. This show that behaivor is affected by the surrounding.",
        "In my opnion, although we are all dectated by geneic traits, famility contact and education as well as social inviroment have a greater effect in deciding who will eventually become. Social interactions teach us what is eccepted and not, what is the correct manner to approach a situation and how to react in it. Without it, i believe we will not be who we are today.",
        "As always, the truth is somewhere in the middle. Genetics and enviromental factors shape us into who we are and who we will react. Only by continued research will we find the final part of the pazzle."
