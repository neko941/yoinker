        "Compare to decades ago, we can perform a lot of activities by just a few clicks. We used to buy newspaper every morning if we would like to read news. Nowadays, we can just take out our phone, open an application on our phone, and watch events happening right now live online. Purchasing online is also getting easier than ever, some believe shops in towns and cities will all be closed eventually. In this essay, I am going to discuss if online something will lead to all shops in towns and cities closing.",
        "Some believe due to the shopping online is getting popular, all shops in towns and cities will be closed at the end. They think shopping online is more accessable, you can do it anytime, anywhere, and purchase almost anything, from groceries to flight tickets, from clothes to foods. For that reason, physical shops will become obsolete. Shops will be unnecessarily as not only customer have a better experience buying online, but also the shop owner does not have to pay rent for the shop. Therefore, they believe shops in towns and cities will be closed due to the impacts brought by the online shop.",
        "However, others think shops will not be closed as they believe shops provide more values than just providing goods to customers. Goods can be purchase online, but some experience cannot be duplicated. Customers can touch and feel the products they are going to purchase, they can compare the product side by side. They can chill in a cafe after their coffee, a waiter explain the coffee they just had was from South Africa, and his experience when purchasing coffee in Africa. These are the experience that cannot be duplicated online at this moment.",
        "I believe all shops in towns and cities will not be closed as physical stores does provide value that we cannot get from the online shops at this moment. However, I can see it will be a big impact to shops that can only provide goods to customers without any additional value."
