        "Nowadays people give their children the liberty to live their lives on their own terms. Parents do not wish to restrict their children, but children require some guidance from elders from time to time.",
        "Children do not know their limitations and end up spending majority of their time in watching TV and playing computer games. This becomes a major setback in their education as well as physical well being.",
        "Parents should also inculcate the habit of reading in children from an early age. It not only gives them wide knowledge but also helps them greatly in improving their vocabulary, imagination and is a good hobby for them to spend time effectively.Parents should also encourage kids to involve in outdoor activities as it would keep them fit and healthy.",
        "Playing computer games only has a negative impact.Many adolescents these days are actively involved in playing computer games and are addicted to the virtual world of gaming. This is a major worry for parents as it affects the mental health of their children. For example, in recent times there came a deadly game which led to the suicide and killing of many young adults who played the game. It was said to be the very rule of the game, to do criminal or harmful tasks and finally kill themselves. Many families were wretched because of such games as the youngsters had no choice but to complete the tasks once they started the game.This was a huge issue worldwide and finaly led to the ban of such games in various countries.",
        "Watching television within a set limit is could be allowed as it also gives certain level of exposure of what is happening around the world,but definitely isn't a great boon to children.",
        "Ruskin Bond said \"Books are one's best friend\", they give children a gateway to imagine and dream. Reading books, not only are informative but also has a lot of live scenarios which may at some point of time help in making decisions in life.",
        "Hence, the conclusion is that parents should definitely put a hold on children from playing computer games and watching television for long hours as it has only negative impacts.On the other hand reading books is a very good habit which does not harm the children in any way and only has pros to it."
