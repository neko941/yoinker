        "Nowadays, the detrimental  effects of obesity on people have been debated significantly between health care system experts. I strongly agree that having regular sport exercises are beneficial and crucial at schools.",
        "To begin with,  a minority of people believe to squander more time at school for sports can deteriorate children\u2019s scores who are strict in their basic lessons which are interfere with Math and chemic. Nonetheless,  parents believe children do not have sufficient time to spend for sports at schools. Hence they persist their children to attain high scores and decrease the time of sports although may neglect their health and throw them on brutal risk. In addition, they depict if they increase the time of exercises children might be exhaust and lead to miss the gist of lessons.",
        "In any quest to compensate the lack of sports time\u2019s schools, skillful experts  have demonstrated accelerating sports time can flourish and improve the power of brain\u2019s regions which are deal with solving complicate lessons and relieve stress. Moreover sports can increase the content of lungs to absorb high levels of oxygen and promote the brain\u2019s functions. Plus those children who they have a strong muscles and are in good shape all of which are consequences they have high self-esteem because they appear gorgeous an handsome in public. I strongly better children with  high self confidence are successful than another because if schools encourage children to have a more time for sports they will attain high scores in their final exams. Furthermore the children who are in shape and pleasant and so forth all of which are the consequences of doing exercise, that lead to saving money not only can they be health but also they do not spend a vast sum of money for disease.",
        "In conclusion, the rate accelerating obesity between people is dangerous and it is crucal for experts write various articles about that and encourage schools to have a more physical education lessons. It my believe, families should pay attention children\u2019s health and listen to the health care system alarms and support then for increasing sport times."
