        "It is getting more popular when adults permit children to use various gadgets for playing games extending their technical abilities in such way. It could cause some troubles with decreasing of communication skills, but I believe that development of new competences is more beneficial for youngsters.",
        "Children who are involved in playing computer games could be less socialized then those who dedicate more time being outside. It is crucial for young people to develop their communication skills for success in future life and lower interaction with friends could have perilous effects on them, but harmful influence could be reduced by strict time management from adults. For instance, some of my schoolmates met a lot of new friends in real life after playing virtual games together just one hour per day.",
        "Technical skills are very important for all people in modern world, especially for children. The most useful competence nowadays is ability to find relevant information in reliable sources. Playing computer games allows youngsters to be more familiar with technical opportunities and issues as well. For example, my niece who used to play on her tablet is more aware about growing cyber dangers and also, she always tries to check information to be sure everything is right. That is why it is useful to help children to learn cutting-edge technology even by playing.",
        "Although there are some weak sides of spending time playing on computer like lack of communication, its amount could be controlled by parents. Benefits which could be received by youngsters from using innovative technology gives them bigger awareness and confidence. That is why advantages of playing on gadgets outweigh any drawbacks."
