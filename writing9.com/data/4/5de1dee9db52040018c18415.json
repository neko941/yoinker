        "used by the city to build a recreational park. This would create a sense of community which in turn provide a place for the children can go to after school or on the weekend, reduce pollution and increase attraction.",
        "The recreational park builds a sense of community, a place of where you get to explore wildlife and also learn about nature, history and life of the community you currently live in. People tend to appreciate a place of serene and nature. Research shows that community with recreational park helps the family to bond more while children knowing more about animals and plants.",
        "The recreational park reduce the air pollution, but compare to a shopping complex where you have  so many business which may use equipment which may be harmful to the environment, With a recreational park, you worries less on the big build and equipment used to sustain the build because everything has to do with nature. Community with recreational park encounter less of health problem compared to the ones with shopping complex as evidence in Durban town.",
        "The recreational park also increase attraction as people from the neighbouring cities would visit to explore the town and the new developed park with the natural habitants found there. Researchers having explored the whole province, had notice that most towns have more of the shopping complex and no have yet to explore having a recreational park which is very educative for all.",
        "This is to say reenact again that it would be best if the city decides to use the undeveloped space to build recreational park because it creates a sense of community which provide a place for the children can go to after school or on the weekend, reduce pollution and increase attractions."
