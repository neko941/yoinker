        "Many professionals argue that it is more proactive for little kids to kickstart learning a language asides their parents at preliminary instead of high school. This essay would discuss how early introduction to foreign languages is better than later.",
        "On the one hand, distortion of our culture would occur when children are forced early to speak in other tongues asides theirs. This is when these young minds are ready to pick up real meaning of every word they hear, hence, they pay attention to all things.  Some are likely not to speak their native language in future. For example, majority of children in big cities in Nigeria like Lagos and Abuja cannot communicate in their native language.",
        "On the other hand, the better time to introduce new franca is at a tender age when their brain is very focus on learning things around them, then, catching them young with a diverse range of languages. Reports from department of linguistics, in University of Lagos and Obafemi Awolowo University ile ife, reveal that children exposed to learning other countries' tongues earlier in primary do perfectly compared to those exposed to in post primary school.",
        "To conclude, though, earlier introduction of foreign language in kindergarten might distort indigenous language, however it is more profitable when because the youngsters get to master the language better than when they were introduced to it in college"
