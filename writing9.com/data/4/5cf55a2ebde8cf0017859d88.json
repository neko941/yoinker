        "To finish high-school, is the first important step of a person\u2019s life. This is because, once that level of education is reached, it is time to decide which one will be the path, the young adult will follow, for the rest of his life.",
        "Naturally, after ending, such a long way, there would be some people that will prefer, to take some time for thinking about their possibilities or maybe, just for relaxing after all the effort done. This pause, before starting the next phase, might have possite and negative consequences. This essay will discuss some of them.",
        "Many young students have a hard time deciding about the life they want to live after high-school. Therefore, this kind of students, might be highly beneficiated if they make a stop in their life, before deciding if they want to continue higher education, or to start a job with low requirements of training, for the rest of their life.",
        "The time for thinking better,before making an important decision, is an extraordinary advantage. Probably, there will be some students using their time for travelling and relaxing, before restarting again. Also, there will be others that will prefer to use their time, making some money that will help them to pay further studies, or just, for experiencing what it is to live from a simple job. Either it is for relaxing and recharging energies before restarting the studies, or just for experiencing the burden of an employment, both experiences can be considered valueble for young people.",
        "The disadvantage of a pause after high-school, is the risk of losing motivation for future challenges. For example, those ones that decide to travel and relax, might find really difficult to go back on track, to their studies. If people lose the practice of reading and dedication to learn, to restart again, might suppose a big challenge. For those who decided to start working and making money, it may be difficult to let go, the income they are already receiving, in order to have enough time, for attending their studies.",
        "In conclusion, to make a stop for clarifying the ideas, or getting more prepared for facing the challenges after high-school, might be beneficial for young students, but just for a brief time, in order to avoid the loosing of the correct path."
