        "Across many countries worldwide, long ago, there were many  houses which were built in the same infrastructure and today some people still believe than the same style of houses should continue to be built. However, there are people who do not perceive it in the same way and they believe that people should have the permission from the local authorities to construct their houses as they wish. In the next paragraphs we will discuss about both views.",
        "In the past, all houses were built in the same way as there was not a variety of materials as nowadays. Moreover, architects and engineers were in fewer numbers and they have to follow the rules that the authorities have set for a house construction.But still, there are people continuing to build houses in the same old fashioned way. In this new era, we can observe that the infrastructure and design of houses are changing. As far the concept of the houses and the plan of the building are certified by an architect and engineer, the authorities should allow people to build the house of their choice.",
        "Today, people have dreams of designing their own houses as they wish. In addition, a house is where someone should fill relaxed and happy to live in. I believe that the government should give the right to people to build their houses in their own way as long they respect all rules. When you visit a place with the same home style, it becomes boring. However when you visit a place where  you see a panoply of houses it becomes interesting to visit this place.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that people should get the choice to build their house of their choice as long they follow the norms set by the government. Thus, the old fashion house should be discontinued to be built."
