        "A number of youngsters all over the world have become less much attentive to update news reported on newspapers and TV. The main roots of this issue lies in the rise of the Internet, which will be discussed in more details below with suggested solutions.",
        "It can\u2019t be denied that Internet has impressively transformed the way we receive information. Have never before keeping up to date with the world been as easy and cheap as nowadays thanks to the internet. Just by a click of mouse we can get any news from anywhere all over the world with almost no cost incurred. It is obviously much more convenient and efficient to get info from Internet than traditional media such as printed newspapers, TV. Hence, youngsters who are digital natives find it more appealing to follow news on the Internet.",
        "On the other hand, it could be a double-edged sword. From the positive view, youngsters who don\u2019t get news updated via traditional method would choose online method, by which is still beneficial and informative. However, many others get carried away with what we call \u201ctrash or fast-food info\u201d. These may include gossips from social media, online tabloids, etc. Such information can be very entertaining but not educational nor informative in the long run. Henceforth, this is truly a worrying problem that we must deal with.",
        "Another reason for the lack of updating news via TV/ newspapers is by personal preference of youngsters themselves. Today we are bombarded with a lot of negative news all over the world since chaos are everywhere. Some young people choose not to be up-to-date because simply they do not want to be affected by bad news. They feel that modern life has been stressful enough so to top it up with terrorist attacks, environmental destruction would do no good to mental health.",
        "So how do we deal with this issue? First and foremost, there should be a control over flow of information. For any piece of news be broadcasted, there must exist validation process to back up its trustworthiness and rightness. Secondly, there should also be incentives to encourage youngsters to read news from orthodox sources whether it is traditional or digital. This can be done by guiding people from early ages to form a habit of reading news from reputable media brands such as CNN, BBC. Last but not least, media companies also need to invent different methods to capture youngsters\u2019 attention without making exaggerated or even fake statements.",
        "All in all, the fact that youngsters no longer follow news from TV and newspapers is not an issue if they use a much more efficient tool like Internet. However, if they let themselves be lured away by other non-educational data on the Internet then that is worrying. Only a co-operative effort of Governments, media bodies, schools, families and the young people themselves can address this problem."
