        "The reason for the upsurge in cases of obesity is debateable. A school of thought attribute the escalation in cases of obesity among children to the government while other people believe that parents are to blame. This essay will look at both sides of the divide and explain why parents should be held responsible for cases of obesity among the young ones.",
        "Perhaps seen as the most important reason why government should be held responsible for the rising cases of overweight among  children is because the duty to enact laws and regulation that will limit the availability of food items that cause obesity rest on the state. This ailment is usually caused by eating certain processed foods which are rich in carb and cholesterol, and to limit the presence on these foodstuffs in market, the regulators can issue decrees banning companies from producing these items. For example, due to the increase in number of people reporting to hospital for excess fat, the government of Edo state, in Nigeria recentlly stopped the sale of processed food across all 18 local government in the state and this saw a drop in new cases. Besides, The increased incidence of excess weight has also been traced to lack of information on how to live healthly and the government share a greater responsiilty in ensuring that the right information is passed on to the masses. When Guardians of our young ones are not well informed on the choice of diet, they tend to feed them with inappropriate food items, thereby leading to childhood obesity.",
        "Notwithstanding, parents have a critical role to play as they are primarily responsible during the formative years of their wards. From birth, children do not choose what to eat, they rather rely on their parents to make choices for them and determine the quantity of food they eat. Hence, this has placed the father or mother in a postion to determine if the child wil be obessed or not. In addtion, Guardians are expected to lead by examples and our little ones are known to learn quickly by observing adults around them. If a child sees and adult always eating pocessed food, there's the high tendency that such person will only want to eat such foods. This further substantiate the fact that parents, being  role model to their children have a critical role to play in ensuring that their children eat healthy.",
        "Having looked at the role of Parents and government, it is apt to say that the the role of parents is more pivotal when it comes to the escalated rate of overweight among children because every father or mother 's first responsibilty is to ensure a child is well taken care off. The goverment has a secondary responsibility in this regards.",
        "In cnclusion, it is obvious that both the government and parents should be held responsible for the rising cases of obesity, however parents  are more liable."
