        "In past every country had its own design of building which reflected their culture and to make house adopt to the location\u2019s climate changes. People in past were wiser and they knew which material is best for to build the house in some particular place. In modern society the building architectural design is same almost everywhere. For example, city building plan: in city center there are skyscrapers or tall buildings close to center there are similar apartments and in suburban areas and country sides there are houses with two floor. This system is same everywhere regardless of their culture, climate changes and so on. Modern building didn\u2019t have anything similar to past time buildings and unlike past time buildings modern building don\u2019t have any cultural reflection of the country.",
        "The reason for this is that world population increasing rapidly and to provide house for everyone people start building tall apartments which could fit more people. It is hard to call this good or bad thing because it destroys cultural values of country but if they stick to old time building there will not be enough places for people to live. But I think it is close to bad thing because some countries when they build modern building they don\u2019t adapt it for their own climate for example building tall building in a place where earthquakes are common which is dangerous.",
        "In conclusion there are a lot places where old building is restored. But I don\u2019t think that is enough I think they should adapt the modern building to their climate and culture."
