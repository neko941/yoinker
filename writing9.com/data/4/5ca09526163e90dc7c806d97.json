        "It is argued that despite fossil fuel being the predominant energy provision, alternatives are being explored as a substitute and becoming an infinitely preferable option. It seems that this trend is greatly desirable. This essay will elaborate on some reasons to justify this stance.",
        "First and foremost, the primary benefit of alternative fuel compared to conventional energy sources would appear to be its inexhaustible supply. That is to say, as power is derived from natural forces including sun, wind or water which are inherently replenished, it is likely not to be used up, hence ensuring the infinite generation. A furthur well-known factor relates to its friendliness to ecology. In other words, as compared to traditional energies at the expense of environment and thereby taking a toll on the population, the development of these sustainable resources emit little or no carbon dioxide, it proves to bring in the necessasy carbon cuts. A prime example can be seen in Iceland where this appears to be the case and a number of countries follow suit. The nation has increased its investment in renewables to almost 100% of its energy, having had good environmental credentials. To the ardent proponents of the idea, these advantages are quite convincing.",
        "Admittedly, it is true that there are some negatives to the use of alternative fuel, most notably its extortionate cost in discourage the exploitation of these unconventional sources. Despite this, it seems that these issues are outweighed by pleasures as the displacement will definitely addresss the plight of power scarcity while hardly doing harm to the environment.",
        "On balance, albeit the undesirable effects, there is an array of favourable argumentation to explain why the substitution is approving. It is projected that on the horizon by cutting back on carbon emissions countries around the world are making major strides in stemming the rate of increase and will probably reverse the process of global warming."
