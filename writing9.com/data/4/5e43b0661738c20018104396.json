        "There is a trend towards renting home rather than buying them. Living is a basic necessity of human needs. So standardized living is the top priority of every man. There are some benefits and drawbacks of renting a home, which will be discussed in the essay.",
        "People are involved in multitasks to earn money. For the purpose of business ,many landlords used to rent out their homes to tenants. There are some benefits of doing it, firstly it is a monthly source of income. Secondly  everyone is in dire need of it. So it is a profitable job/business . Thirdly, those who settled abroad  instead of leaving their property unattended, they prefer to hand over to safe hands. Through contract, that person is accountable for it.",
        "However, there are few disadvantages to rent a house. Firstly, no one can assess anyone while giving its assets to others either he is a criminal or honest person. In addition, many of them don\u2019t care properly about the home ,this leads to damaging  rooms and other parts of it. For instance, due to the carelessness, it can cause huge damage or violation.",
        "To conclude, if someone has  made it for purpose of business ,they should have a continous check on it. It\u2019s a better choice for some people who cannot afford to buy their own houses and it is the most convenient way of living for them."
