Everyone has their own reason for attending university.",

The high school graduates enroll to gain knowledge about the career that they pursue for some of them this could be last chance to study and some adult people who has job attend to increase their knowledge about their work to get career growth and etc. Also while studying main course in university students can learn about other subject related to their course and they can interact with their classmates.",
