        "University or college is the main source of the knowledge and education. In past university or even schools are attended only by children of rich and noble people. But now everyone can get education regardless of their wealth or social status. Unlike schools most of universities or colleges doesn\u2019t have age restriction which means everyone can enroll. Everyone has their own reason for attending university.",
        "The first and main reason is education. Most of the student attend university to increase their knowledge in some particular field. The high school graduates enroll to gain knowledge about the career that they pursue for some of them this could be last chance to study and some adult people who has job attend to increase their knowledge about their work to get career growth and etc. Also while studying main course in university students can learn about other subject related to their course and they can interact with their classmates.",
        "Secondly some people enroll to get new experience and start new career or change their current job. They might not like their current job and they want to study new more interesting for them field. Attending university teach students to live and make a decision on their own.",
        "In conclusion university and college offer not only career but also the opportunity to have new experience and learn all kinds of things. I think these are the main reasons for attending universities."
