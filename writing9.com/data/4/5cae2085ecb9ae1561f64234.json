        "biggest drawback to private-owned hospitals is the exorbitant cost patients have",
        "to pay. When governments do not introduce restrictions on such costs, many",
        "private institutions set high fees for services such as prescriptions charges or",
        "using high-tech machines in the operating theatre, which effectively",
        "discriminates against those on low or modest incomes who cannot afford the",
        "costs for care and treatment. Additionally, as the ultimate aim of these agencies",
        "is to gain profits, it is possible that they will focus more on quantity rather than",
        "quality. With seemingly less qualified and less experienced medical",
        "practitioners, private hospitals might not come up to patients\u2019 expectations.",
        "On the other hand, there are justifiable reasons why privately-run health care",
        "institutions should be made available. Firstly, they provide faster services,",
        "unlike public health services where there is often a long waiting list. Therefore,",
        "it is less time-consuming for either patients with life-threatening diseases or",
        "those coming for aregular check-up to get the treatment they want. Secondly,",
        "private healthcare institutions could be a practical alternative to state-funded",
        "ones in remote areas. If more of these agencies were established in less",
        "accessible regions, more people would be able to enjoy improved health care,",
        "especially those from minority groups who barely receive any primary health",
        "care at present.",
        "In conclusion, despite the drawbacks of medical services being provided by",
