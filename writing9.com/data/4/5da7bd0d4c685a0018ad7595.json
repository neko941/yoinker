        "Compared to traditional families, there are a lot of families where both parents are working these days. However, there are some arguments on which is better for child bearing - is it the one where only one parent work or both parents go out to work?",
        "On one side if both mother and father go to work to earn money to raise their children, the financial condition of the family becomes better than that of a family where only one parent work. In addition, the increase in family income could give a better condition in rearing children; for instance, for their education or for raising them. On the negative, when both parents' are absent in the house, it could result to a lack of support and care for the children . For example, there is no one who cares for the child after finishing school.",
        "The right solution to child bearing are different every decades or century. Because the tendancy to caring a child are changing based on each social situation. In the traditional period, most of mother took care of their children at home, and their husband went out to work. But we do not need to do same thing anymore. There are several reason why both parents should go out to work. However, I can insist this opinion with using only one reason.",
        "In the past, the reason why one side of parents, especially mother, stayed at home and took care of their children is that because of lack of opportunity of work to women. Women could not get a chance to work in the past. However, because of improving women\u2019s rights, many of women, it is called to wife in this case, can find their job outside of their family. Following this tendency of working mother, there are a lot of welfare to raise children from government. So people do not need to take care of their children with giving up their job. For example, in the South Korea, there is government baby sitter system. If the family which has working mother need to baby sitting program, when they go out to work, government provide the teachers who are educated to official center to take care of their children and provide the money which is the cost of 70% to hire baby sitter. And there are a lot of after school program in the kingdergarden and elementary school. And because of working mother, family have the additional income. It means that parents can provide better service or opportunity to their chidlren.",
        "Both parent\u2019s travail does not always bring a lack of support of children. Both parent\u2019s working outside of family is tendency of this century. And the changing of this tendency make better policy to raise chidlren. That\u2019s why both parents should go out to work to their family."
