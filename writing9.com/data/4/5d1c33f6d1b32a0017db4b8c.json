In foreign countries , school authorities and parents encourage their children to interact in different activities because the aim to improve the quality of team spirit which may helpful for their future.",

So thay will diversily affect to thier life . that is because , students who consendrate only in studies may suffer siviour mental problems like depression. tht is why some childrens seems to be desprate and low energetic.",
