        "Entertrainment mediums plays a crucial role in an individual's life. Some believe that the attitude of people gets influenced adversely by playing computer based games and watching serials or movies which delivers negative lessons, on the other hand, other argue that the behaviour does not get impacted by television and computer games. In this essay, I completely accord with the former one.",
        "To embark on, there are numerous amount of entertrainment channels which varies from person to person to feel fascinated. In earlier days, people used to choose playing some outdoor games and prefer to get social in their leisure time, however, nowadays, people become so lazy due to their hectic schedules, that they don't even want to acknowledge their guests itself. Apart from this, the computer games and serials are derived in such a way that they become the addiction for those who have a played just a couple of stages or watched few episodes respectively. People would learn team work, if they tend to ignore typical serials in televison and games in computer.",
        "Moreover, an individual's habit is one which develops by his or her surroundings, be it through friends in their team or some guests. What exactly is the reason to prefer these mediums to be prominent ? The answer is, the ignorance from society, as there is a drastic change observed in the culture these days and it is, the dual earning in a family. In such cases, people who are working gets engaged in their offices whilst other who stays at home feels  ignored, due to lack of guidance. Infact, sometimes they might feel frustrated and lonely too. People then look for playing computer games and watching television and they are found to follow what they notice from these entertrainment channels. Also many of the games are of fight and revenge only, same they follow at home too. Hence, if proper assistance is given to people at home, their behaviour might be improved elegantly.",
        "To recapitulate, I completely agree that people should avoid watching televison and playing computer games as their behaviour starts resembling with such serials in television which inturn make them more healthy and social. Also, one should be there to show the right path for people tend to play computer games and choose television as a way of getting happier."
