        "Discipline plays an significant role in the life of everybody. Issues related to the discipline enhancing in the modern schools. Fewer of the masses believe that it is the responsibility of guiders to teach students about discipline whereas others opine that guardians have a essential part in teaching discipline to their children.This essay will discuss both the aspects,as students spend more time in school the teachers should aware them about discipline and parents need to explain the advantages of discipline.Eventually,I will also express my view point as well.",
        "Why individuals opine that it is the duty of teachers to guide the students about discipline since the learners pass a lot of time with their tutors,they have sufficient time to learn about the discipline,along with this today\u2019s world schools should organise some lectures as well as they will also encourage students to follow discipline with the help of giving prizes to the most disciplined student of the class on the monthly bases.To cite an example,in Delhi Public School,Kurukshetra about 85% of learners obey the rules and regulations of the school because teachers arrange 2 to 3 lectures every week about discipline.Thus,it is quite justified that putting more efforts by teachers in teaching discipline to students has positive consequences.",
        "While the other view emphasises that parents are responsible to guide their children about discipline because parents are the first tutor of their child,so they should teach their children regarding positive results of obeying the discipline in their life.For instance,one of my friend is living in a joint family,he has brilliant manner and etiquettes due to the instructions of his parents,it will also beneficial for him in the future.",
        "Discipline is the practice of making people obey rules or standards of behaviour,and punishing them when they do not.This essay has discussed why some multitudes think that teachers are responsible to give proper information about discipline to the students as learners spend spend more time with their guiders whereas,others assume that parents has significant role in this because they are the first teacher of their children.I personally believe that guiders should cocern more about teaching discipline to students."
