        "Language is a way which connects people around the world.Some experts opine that learning a language at primary school is having more benefits rather than at secondary school.In this essay in the following paragraphs, I intend to delve into the advantages and disadvantages.",
        "Language plays a vital role in the overall development of the child.To begin with, to connect with individual from different countries around the world,it is important to understand the language spoken in that country, as it helps in educational information exchange between them.Studying a language at primary level is having more importance, as learning capabilities at this stage is quite high. Furthermore, the kids at an early age have more tendency to learn and implement something new, which become difficult as the age grows.It provides kids an opportunity to participate at an international competition.",
        "To add further, seeing the potential in international languages, school nowadays are introducing Foreign language in their curriculum.Parents  also want their kids to have knowledge of any other country language, as it helps the kids to grow further in their life.Moreover,due to the induction of the foreign language , a plethora of people are looking at language as their career.",
        "The proponents of language learning at secondary school opine that learning another language at primary level is better,as at this point of time child grasping power is more and therefore, it is the best time to learn language.But the fact is, at this age, child are completely busy with day to day activities and hence could not devote much time.Learning a foreign language is just becoming an optional subject for them, as a result, they show less interest.",
        "To conclude, studying international language is a necessity nowadays.For me the pros outweigh the cons."
