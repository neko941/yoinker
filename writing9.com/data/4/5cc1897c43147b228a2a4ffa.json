        "Language is the most important tool for communication ,and is different in parts of the world .Even local areas of same countries have their own local languages .So in order to communite and learn efficiently you must know the specific langauge .Most of the people speak their mother tongue very fluently but when it comes to other langauge they are not able to communicate so well r reluctant to take part in conversation.Now english has become international language  so most of the educational institutions are emphasizing on learning english in early life so that children do not have any problem in their professuinal life",
        "Man is social animal and is gifted with receptive mental abilities. These learning abilities are at their peak in early life so this is the best stage that could help us overcome the language barrier . Although most of th children  speak their local language but some experts bilieve that primary school stage is best stage where they should start learning english or any foreign langauge because their learning abilities are peak .if they learn english or any foreign language at primary school stage they will will be confident in their secondary school stage .They will confidently take part in all educational and extracuricular activities hence they will flourish and even if they go abroad for further studies or job purpuse they will be prefferred .",
        "on the other hand student student learning english or any other foriegn lanuage in secondary school stage will not learn it efficiently as their mind is not as much receptive and they also have more burden of studies as compared to primary school group  .so they  will not take part actively in different conversation as compared to primary school groups and even grades are low as they can not cope with lengthy and dificult salybus",
        "so the analysis concludes that  the experts who believe  that learning english at primary school are right as children who learn english at primary school have more advanteges  as compared to other grourp they are more successful in all stages of life and and have more oppurtunities of learning communation.They are more successful in professional life."
