        "It is a debated issue whether history has been useful to mankind or has little or nothing to tell us. These two arguments will be delved into in this eassy and my own opinion given.",
        "History is studied by most people to have a better knowledge of previous occurrences and answer so many questions. For example, the war between Isreal and Gaza will be well understood if traced back to the ancient times and these answers given will help the younger generation know the origin and cause of this war. Also, history which is a subject taught in school of recent gives the younger ones an insight about their country, their founding fathers, culture and traditions of the country.",
        "Furthermore, family history should be passed from generation to generation so as to have an idea of hereditary diseases, allergies and other types of sickness present in the family. For example, families which suffer high blood pressure should learn to keep away from stress and check blood pressure constantly to be in the know.",
        "On the other hand, some people find history boring and not worth their time because they believe they past cannot give them an idea about the present since there is newer invention of technology and life is fast changing. Therefore, they need to embrace such changes and move on with their life.",
        "In my opinion,history should be made a mandatory course in schools, because children need to have know about their country and world entirely. Secondly, families should teach their children family traditions and rituals, origins and believes. As this unites the family more.",
        "In conclusion,i pen down saying that knowledge from history helps to form they youngsters."
