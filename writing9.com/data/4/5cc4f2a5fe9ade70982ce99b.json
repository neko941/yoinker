        "It is true that a lot of students are trained to push themselves and compete to their classmates instead of studying in a group for mutual benefits. While I acknowledge that there are some advantages of competition, I believe that the drawbacks do outweigh the benefits.",
        "On the one hand, there are some benefits of competitiveness that are considered as an efficient way to achieve goal. The primary benefit is that children will become more mature, independent and dedicated. Competing with others forces students to obtain high score in class, thus, they have to equip themselves with a reservoir of knowledge by self-study and searching more materials. Another benefit is competition enable students to have enough skills to run in a harsh race in the future. Therefore, when they are employed, it is possible for them to climb career ladder and fulfill ambition of success.",
        "On the other hand, it seems to me that group study is the best choice for student progress. Firstly, in a group with mixed-ability students, advanced students can experience the satisfaction of helping  less-able learners and modelling more complex ideas. This practice not only builds confidence in the advanced students but also helps weak students move forward and have more intriguing learning methods. Secondly, collaboration requires students to have teamwork and communication skills, which are practical necessity in their future. By these skills, it is easy for students to get along with their counterpart in their jobs and foster the relationship bond.",
        "In conclusion, while competition promotes self-study ability of children, I believe that studying in a group should be applied for a majority of students."
