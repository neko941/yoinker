        "Advertisement is a tool that helps consumer to identify a product or service. It is a way of sharing a story about a product or service. History shows that story telling had been a part human evolution. The method which has changed since the days of cave paintings to today\u2019s graphic designing.",
        "Companies, brands have been using this concept since the idea of consumerism have been established, probably even before the paper was manufactured. In my opinion advertisements helps us to know about new products.",
        "Today we see advertisements on various platforms like print media, radio, television, internet and social media. There are myriad formats of advertisements too; like commercials, posters, banners, hoarding, radio jingles, online ads, influencer marketing etc.",
        "I personally love short commercials which tells us a story. The recent Dove commercial which reflects women empowerment is a brilliant ad campaign. They shared stories of different women from different walks of life across the globe and never did they mention their product except at the end. The ad was a success as it was an awareness project which ditched the old idea of beauty and that women in today\u2019s world is capable of doing any work. Similarly, another ad which caught my attention was Coca-Cola promoting its \u201cAvengers\u201d can launched during the release of the new \u201cAvengers\u201d movie.  It simple talked about its new product using the recent trend. Another great Indian campaign was \u201cA drop of life\u201d on polio drops was the pivotal success in putting India on the map of polio free nation.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to say advertisement is a beautiful art that helps us to know of different things around us and we always have a choice to make the right decision for ourselves regarding a purchase. We really cannot blame it advertisements."
