        "Some would argue that the better means to improve citizen\u2019s health is through providing more sports facilities while others say that there is a requirement of other solutions because that would affect less on public health. Although sports facilities are good way to change public health, I believe that it is better to implement other measures.",
        "On the one hand, implementing more number of sports facilities the citizens can easily access to nearest sports area and de exercises and other physical activities. People will become strengthens physically and tend to participate in different kinds of sports which",
        "ultimately help the nation. For example, there are 70% of peoples said that they don\u2019t do exercise because of lack of facilities in their areas reported by one survey in India. However, I believe that this does not mean that the health ratio will increase because it only affects",
        "physically and there are other criteria which should be included.",
        "On the other hand, providing more sports facilities will help to improve physical health which fulfils only one criteria to improve health completely. The diet is also major factor in improvement because it affect inside of the body parts and improving them. If a person does exercise only and not concentrate on diet than there not any chance to improve particular\u2019s health in an effective way because whatever he or she eat are more important to improve",
        "health. For example, there are 90% of the gym trainers said physical exercise and diet are base to improve health in one article of the newspaper. I believe that this factor is as mandatory as sports facilities because without it there will be no change in actual health.",
        "In conclusion, while rising up sports facilities give one aspect to improve health, the diet is also major factor to consider because it improves inside part of the body."
