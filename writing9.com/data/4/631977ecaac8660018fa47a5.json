        "In recent years, with the development of technolgies the use of social sites scaled up rapidly across the world. Although these sites has so many usefulnesses, there are several drwabacks too. Here, both the pros and cons will be explained in the subsequent paragraphs.",
        "Let's begin with the benefits of social medias. In the current world, people are too busy with diverse activities that they barely get time to visit their families or friends. As a solution to this problem, apps like messenger, what's app, instagram etc. came up with different features through which we can easily communicate with our loved ones despite living in remote places. Therefore distances became closer and also time and money are no longer creating obstacles in communication and networking. In addition, platforms like likedin helps us to be up to the mark about professionals without any direct contact. Moreover, we are now more connected and can access more due to the blessings of social sites.",
        "Now, let's move on with the inconveniences induced by social medias. One of the most damaging effect of social sites is the spreading of rumours within moment which can take lives of innocents. For example, several suicide incidents took place in many countries just because of the humiliation over social medias. Another point worth mentioning is that, due to many attarctive functions, many of us spend our valuable times on meaningless contents which is alarming to our productivity.",
        "However, despite all the negative impacts social platforms are now a part of our daily life which we may not completely get rid of. But we must control the usages of networking medias so that our main tasks are not hampered."
