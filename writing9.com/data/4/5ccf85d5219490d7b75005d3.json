        "Since 1990s, the internet is booming at such a high rate that almost everyone in the developed countries has access to the internet in some form or the other. It has helped people to access wealth of information and connect with their friends and family through social media. But, it also poses risks to people's personal information and children are getting addicted to their phones.",
        "Nowadays, with the advancements in the mobile phones and cheaper internet data plans, more and more people are getting connected to the internet than ever before. People can read about the latest news, events and many other things from all around the world in just a few seconds.",
        "But due to the ease of accees to the information, many people don't realize that their personal information such as birth date, passwords, social security number, bank account numbers and other private data can be stolen by hackers if they don't keep it secured. For instance, man hackers send the malicious software to people through email and if you click the link present in the email, they get access to you computer or mobile phone and may get access to your bank accounts also.",
        "The other big problem due to internet access is that the children in the current generation are so much addicted to their phones that they waste a lot of their precious time browsing though internet or watching videos on youtube. This hamper their studies which in turn affects their career in a long run",
        "As a result, I think that although internet has provided lot of benefit s with the ease of accessing information, it can also turn out into nightmare if your private data is not secured or your children spend too much time on their phones or computers."
