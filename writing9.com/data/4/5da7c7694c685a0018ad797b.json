        "In  recent  years  there  has  been  an  increasing  number  of  discussions about privacy and  media.  While  some  people  think  that  reporters  often  invade celebrities' personal space and life, many othersargue that those famous individuals choose to have  this  lifestyle  and  privacy  is  the  cost of wealth  and  fame.On  the  one  hand, people  who  support that media  reporterscan  follow  celebrities  anywhere,would argue  that  the  attention  given  by  the  public  is good for celebrities' careers. Movie stars and singers with an interesting personal life often remain in the public eye. For example, Jet Li was a skinny boy who was bullied when he was in primary school, but since  then,  he  has  been  learning  martial    artsand trainingto  be  a  Kung  Fu master and action moviestar. His story inspires many people and motivates them to see  his  movies. However,  many  famous  people  havebeen harassed by paparazzi before, invading not only their privacy,but also following their families . For example, the  daughter  of  Jonny  Wong,  a  famous  singer  in  Hong  Kong,  was  constantly ambushed  by  magazine  reporters  who  were  trying  to  interview  her  and  take her photos.  This  behaviour  is  totally  unnecessary  and  should  be  consideredstalking. Furthermore, the attention celebritiesget is often related toy gossipand not to their professions  or  careers.  Many  medias  in  the  entertainment  industry tends to report on  the  personal  life  of  the  stars  instead  of  their  workFor  example  the  love life of Taylor Swift, the singer, sometimes takes precedence over her songs. In conclusion, although  in  some  cases,attentionfrom  the  media  is  beneficial  for  certain  famous people's careers, the indisciplinedbehaviour of the mediaoften invades celebrities \u0301personal  lives and  distractspeople  from  their  art.  It  is  unfair  to  tolerate  such approaches to reporting."
