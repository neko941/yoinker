        "News has a lot to do with human's lives. Importance of the news is mainly because it's the most authentic source of information. But even though news is more engaged with bad news, focus on good news may increase people's happiness.",
        "People count on news to know what's happening around them. In fact, the majority of adults watch the news regularly to be up to date with the most important incidences.",
        "This is because one would feel isolated if he or she is not aware of his or her local and global major updates. A recent study shows that 97 per cent of people in UK agreed that watching news is as important as any other thing in their main daily tasks.",
        "Negative news coverage is higher because the world's good news are less likely to happen. Catastrophes , wars ,  flooding and other bad news happen more often . Especially that media is now covering not only the local societies, they are more likely to hear about the unpleasant incidences.",
        "For instance, the majority of headlines under the CNN is dedicated for world crisis.",
        "Focusing on good news spread positive vibes. As negative news stresses people , the joyful and happy news do the exact opposite thing. For example, knowing that humanity has discovered a certain new invention or a cure for a life threatening disease would positively affect people's mood and overall satisfaction.",
        "In conclusion, while news is very important for people , bad news is sometimes stressful and therefore media should increase their good news coverage."
