        "In recent days, it's been argued that, only governments and large companies can do something to improve the environment and individuals cannot make any much difference. This essay disagrees with the statement eventhough the contribution from the individual for improving the environment is less and it takes several number of years to improve, if we work as an individual.",
        "The government and large companies can improve the environment in quick span of time. Government has all the powers in it's hand to enforce the rule on public and all the companies for not using the products which affects the environment. And, large companies can come forward to restrict the usage of the products which pollutes the environment and dispose their wastages in a proper place and recycle it rather than letting it out on the river, as this will not affect the environment.  This doesn't mean that environment can be saved or improved only by the government and large companies.",
        "Even when the government and large companies failed to do the things said above, Individuals can come upfront and join their hands together to clean up the river, avoid usages of plastics etc.  This will improve the environment to some extent. Plastic bags plays a major role in affecting the stability of an environment. To get over the issue,  as a starting step, One of the guy from chennai, who is an owner of a super market, banned the usage of plastic covers in his store. He had kept a notice in front of his shop stating that, No plastic bags will be provided and customers needs to bring their own cotton bags to carry the items with them. Also he came up one step forward and gave discounts for the customers who brings up cotton bags to carry the purchased item from his shop.",
        "In conclusion, each and every individual can bring up more difference to the environment and make it better by joining hands together. People no need to wait for the government or some companies to take some necessary action to improve the environment."
