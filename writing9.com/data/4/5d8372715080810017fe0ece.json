        "Giving birth was considered the most spiritual",
        "Intro - Heated debate on whether abortion should be made illegal or not has become a constant battle gathering more than required attention to itself. In this essay, we will talk about the why or why not laws are required around this sensitive issue along with my point of view.",
        "There has been an upsurge in the number of abortions owing to variety of reasons. With advances in medical technology is has become earlier to catch any medical deformity a child might develop and hence parents are given a logical choice to abort.  Another reason is unwelcome pregnancies where the parents are not willing to give birth due to various reasons and resort to aborting the fetus. Also, increase in crimes such as rapes have added to the burden, carrying a child from such a mishap becomes a burden for life. Such decisions are personal as children born with disabilities or those who are not planned end up facing many challenges during their lifetime.",
        "Belief remains that the children are gifts from the God and it is the responsibility of the parent to protect and nurture them since their inception. Therefore, when the fetus is killed in the womb it is considered a sin. Elderly often believe kid brings in good luck for the family and one is refrained from tampering with the natural process reproduction.",
        "As a adult in child bearing age, i believe that deciding to give birth to a new human or deciding not to is a concern that the government should refrain from developing laws around them. I am of an opinion that such a decision is extremely personally and only the parents shall decide as to what is best for them",
        "In Conclusion nurturing a child or deciding not to bring him into this world is a personal choice, government should refrain from making any laws that curb one's right to freedom. I am of firm belief that if the parents are not in favor of giving birth to a child and are not medically advised otherwise then they no law or authority have any right to stop them.",
        "Instead of making abortion illegal, I would suggest that the authorities should work towards awareness contraceptive methods and avoiding un welcomed pregnancies"
