        "Leisure activities hold a vital place in everyone's life. People, generally choose such activities according to their taste and preference. However, nowadays it has been observed that with the shift in current lifestyle and updation of old things, fun activities are also changing with ongoing trends. I completely agree that free time activities are undertaken merely to show off one's status and to attract people around.",
        "Admittedly, people in present society are more interested in hobbies that are famous and are performed by their favourite celebrites. This makes them feel up-to-date with latest changes of modern life. For instance, having gymnasium membership is most loved activity for young adults as they watch movies stars doing exercise in stylish workout clothes.",
        "Another reason which incites people to take fashion oriented thing could be constant peer pressure. Is is seen many a times, especially children, compel parents for enrolling them in unusual activity just because their friends are doing that. For example, my 15 years old cousin started taking belly dancing classes under the influence of one of her classmate.",
        "In conclusion, due to advancements in technology, lifestyle habits have changed greatly. As a result, people take up those spare activites which are in demand and new, and in return make them more connected and appreciated in society."
