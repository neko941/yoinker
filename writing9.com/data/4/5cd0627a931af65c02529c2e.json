        "As we have known that \u201c on the way to success, there are no trace of lazy man\u201d. However, in my viewpoint, in order to succeed, we not only need to have hard work but also depend on other factors such as talent, luck and help.",
        "It is not easy to be successful for lazy people. Hard work plays an important role in success. The more time you spend on practicing the shorter the distance to your goal is. For instance, the scientists have to spend a great deal of time and effort researching and experimenting by many different methods before inventing a new device. On the other hand, talented people have more chances to get the accomplishment. for example, there are many. Televised talent shoes for those whom have talent to promote a natural ability so that they are easier to be well known, especially, in modern society. Besides, if you have talent in doing something, the time you spend achieving it will be less than others. Although I and my classmate started studying English at the same time and the same course, she is better than me now, because of her talent in learning language. Those factors mentioned above contribute to success but not everything. Someone are really hardworking and talented but lack of luck or help from right mentors, as this result, they find it so difficult to reach their ultimate purpose.",
        "In conclusion, each person have different way to make their dream become true. I support idea that there are many reasons to succeed and hard work is one of the most significant things to get your goal"
