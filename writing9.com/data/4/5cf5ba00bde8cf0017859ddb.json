        "Undoubtly, technology has helped the people to perform more effitienly, uncountles tasks. Certainly, this fact has positive effects, but also, negative ones. This essay will discuss some of these results.",
        "If we think about the way the industries worked 30 years ago, the first thing that comes to our mind is the number of people that was necessary for operating the machinery. In the past, the labour of workers was essencial for the success of every business. Nowday, the advances in technology have made possible not depend on the labour of workers, since there are machines, replacing them.",
        "The possitive effect, that can be observed, in the situation above, is that the companies are saving resources, and maybe, are even generating more assets. The humans, are not machines, they can not be programmed and their social and emotional problems cant be fixed with a simple maintenance. Therefore, their perform in the different possitions they can fulfill in the jobs, might not be perfect. This weakness in the human being, could cause some issues, in the success of the companies. In this scenario, the technology can help companies to make more profit.",
        "Analizing the negative effects, at a situation, like the one mentioned, the big problem is that, the labour of workers has lost importance. This is something that might be enormeously concerning. If the work of people is not longer necessary, how are the people going to generate their income?",
        "Even when is true, that technology is something good, for improving the productivity and the profit of companies, this value, is not more important than the need of humans to feel appreciated and valueble.",
        "In conclusion, technology must be used with moderation for preventing damages."
