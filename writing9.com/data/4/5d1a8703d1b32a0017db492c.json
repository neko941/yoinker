It is largely because there are only a few top athletes having the chance to win the medals but their routine training demands high-standard facilities which can hardly be used by ordinary people.",
        "In conclusion, when countries raise fund for sports or celebrate the victory of their athletes, they should not neglect the fact that many children are in great need of sports facilities."
