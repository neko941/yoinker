        "Introduction According to people perspective leadership is a god gifted quality that cannot be learned but that people\u2019s perspective and nothing in this world can\u2019t be learned with dedication and repetition. Leadership is an action not a position. The matter of fact is that the practical meaning of leadership is far different from theoretical world. The bookish language will assist you for sure but to be a great leader, a person should hold two qualities courage and persistence along with hard work and that leads him to enormous victories. In my opinion if a person has this god gifted quality and yet does not utilize his true potential in terms of leadership that means he runs his own life by himself and on the other hand if a person aims to change he will ;indeed. \u2018\u2019Man cannot remake himself without suffering for he is both the marble and the sculpture\u2019\u2019 There is an example of leadership qualities of Nelson Mandela who always think for the next generation, never focus election. He always motivate his nation, and picked his nation from the darkness to bright future, he always talked about rule of law and never broke any law. And for those who think that leadership qualities can built actually they were talking about politicians and politicians always show-off their activities just act like leaders but they are not leaders and they not have leadership qualities, they always focused just on the next election to make people fool. The best example of such type people of is Nawaz Sharif from Pakistan. That applies to the fact that if you are desperate enough to attain heights of success then for sure you will attain. This then ends the contradiction that leadership is a quality people are naturally born with, with dedication anyone can learn the art of leadership, coming to the conclusion"
