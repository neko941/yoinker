        "Mankind has always been dependent on forest reserves for various necessities of life.However , due to increasing population and huge industry demand , percentage of forests has decreased  significantly on earth.This has invited a range of problems starting from soil erosion to disruption in water cycle, loss of of animal habitat and aquatic life, rainfall and ultimately global warming.To reduce the adverse effects of deforestation , it is necessary to take steps immediately.",
        "Many world leaders and organizations  has come forward to address the issue of deforestation. It is necessary that governments are encouraged to preserve the forest area and restrict logging industries. Industries can be provided with alternative synthetic material or some money can be invested in the research of the same. Though it takes many years to build a forest,in many countries new forests are built by plantations artificially and such experiments should be carried out more. It will be interesting for each country to have a goal where certain percentage of country\u2019s land should be covered with jungles.",
        "The awareness among humans is very vital to succeed in stopping deforestation. People should understand the harm it causes to environment and human life. The goods made without deforestation should be more promoted to the common people. The importance of forests should be taught in early education and as a responsible citizen everyone should participate in protecting forests.",
        "Forests are natural resources and should be used be used wisely.The critical warnings by nature should not be as a result of our past action and with combined efforts of government and citizens , problems of deforestation should be solved promptly."
