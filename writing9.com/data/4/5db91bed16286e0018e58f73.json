        "Although most people believe that it is the government\u2019s duty to take care of the environment, others think that every human being must be responsible for it. This essay will discuss both of views and give my opinion.",
        "On the one hand, some people think that the state and central authorities need to take care of the environment. In fact, individual\u2019s effort can not make a difference and government who needs to carry out or make conclusions, which help to save environment. For example, the government should introduce laws to limit emissions from factories; thus, they are all in the best position to they make big changes for the betterment of nature.",
        "On the other hand, others believe that if everyone starts taking a small actions, it can make a huge difference. They think that the government is responsible for big issues but if people course of action like taking care by doing a few tiny things differently it can protect our planet. For instance, people should choose to buy a product with less plastic packaging, in this manner, will help reduce pollution. As a result, a small resolution of human beings might help in controlling the pollution caused by non-biodegradable waste.",
        "In conclusion, while people\u2019s opinion may vary in their opinion, I think by small effort of people is more significant in saving the environment."
