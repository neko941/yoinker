        "In modern era, advertisements play important role in sale and marketing of all products. Some people believe that the advertisement influense to buy products while others argue that they provide imformation about new items. This essay will show partial aggrement towards both the views.",
        "To start with, advertisements are vital to market the product because of them only people know about uses and availibilties of any item in the market. The role of commerical adds is to attract people and help raise of sale. For example: if a product caters need of teenager, the advertisment should be created in such a way that it pull these age cotagory consumer to purchase that product. That is the magic of advertisement, despite being unuseful, it market in such a way that consumer believe that they requires this product, without them it would be very difficult to achive desire results.",
        "Furthermore, they are important to describe features, advantages and area covered by new addition in any product. Also, helps in rising awareness about any new product and its corresponding target consumers. For instance: recently, in India, many companies launch air purifies, which are not there in the market so without advertising this product, how comparies could tell use and benift? and create consumer base for niche products. Many adds represent details,  in a way that, it describe all feature of the product and help viewers to know what extra this product can do.",
        "In nutshell, these mean of spreading information about the products ultimatly benift consumer and market both because product manufacturers know what missing in the market and customers know what available in the market. In traditional way this two way comunication was not possible. Hence advertisemnet plays the role to bridge between both."
