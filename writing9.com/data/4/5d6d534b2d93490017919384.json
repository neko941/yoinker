        "Some people believe that talent is of great importance if one must succeed in any sporting activity while others believe that hard work and constant practice is a path way to achieve greatness in sport. Irrespective the validity of both points, in my opinion hard work and consistent practice will go a long way to take a sport man to the top.",
        "On one hand, natural ability is a blessing which people strive and pray to discover because they see it as a surest and smooth way to succeed in life. That being said, you will agree with this school of thought because sportsmen with natural ability do not struggle to adapt to the sport of their choice, they enjoy what they do and always ready to entertain her viewer. Take for an instant, in Spanish football league, some players are recalled to be outstanding because it is belief that they are born to be footballers.",
        "On the other hand, hard work and consistency is the secret of every successful sport man. Hard work and being consistent brings about self-development. Practice they said makes perfect. A man who develops passion in football, gives himself to consistent practice, will over time perfect in what he do Haven given room for self-development, discovery of great skills and of course passion which is the driving force. That, I strongly agree. Take for an instance, the most successful player in soccer is evidently proven to be a product of hard work and consistent training.",
        "In conclusion, people may have their different opinion, but I believe that hard-work and constant practice is the secret of success in sport."
