        "The development in the science and technology has contributed a lot in agriculture sector. Despite of modern techniques and advance technology in agriculture, large number of people are still under starvation.In this essay I intend to discuss possible problems band their solutions.",
        "People are starving due to environmental degradation. Though there are plenty of agricultural land ,it still lacks the sufficient production of agricultural products.It is all due to pollution of land by using excessive fertilizers, pesticides as well as soil erosion.For example, people use huge amount of insecticides and pesticides for the high yield of crops but inreturn it degrades the quality of soil resulting in low production. Moreover, the cutting down of trees to expand agricultural land increases the vulnerability of removint fertile top soil which may cause soil erosion as well as drought.",
        "Inn other hands, various countries on the world lacks the proper irrigation facilities,  as a result insufficient production causing hunger and starvation.for instance, the country like Nepal lacks the proper irrigation facilities in its mountaineous region so,the people have to depend upon the monsoon rain which does not favour everytime and the agricultural outcome in this region is almost  negligible.",
        "The emphasises should be given in using organic fertilizers rather than chemical fertilizers.The use of organic herbicides  does not only increases the fertility of soil but also helps in high production of crops.It does not even degrade the environment instead it helps to maintain balance in eco system.",
        "The other solution can be the proper irrigation facilities in mountaineous and rocky landscapes.To illustrate, instead of depending on natural rain  farmers should have the provision of building water storing dams, canals and channels to distribute water to agricultural fields.",
        "In conclusion, for high yielding of agricultural products the excessive use of inorganic fertilizers should be discarded and priorities should be given in using organic fertilizers.Conservation of environmental factors  plays an important role in promoting agriculture."
