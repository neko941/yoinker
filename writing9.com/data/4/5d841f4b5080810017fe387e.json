        "Given is the line graph revealing information on price alterations of fresh fruits and vegetables, sugars and sweets, and carbonated drinks from 1978 till 2009 in comparison with customer-price index. At the onset, the price of fresh fruits and vegetables increased exponentially, whereas there was a steady upturn in other products listed during the 30-year period.",
        "At the first glance, it is clear that there were almost no differences in the cost of all categories at over $60 in 1979. Over the next 8 years, the price of all food products rose modestly, in spite of certain marginal fluctuations, to approximately $100 that was quite akin to the consumer-price index.",
        "In the last 20-year period, increasing from $125 in 1989 to $325 in 2009, fresh fruits and vegetables were considered to be a most expensive food product which is far higher than consumer index price. When it comes to other food goods that lower than consumer index price, it is apparent that the cost of sugars and sweets reached to roughly $200 in the provided last year, while the price of soft drinks accounted almost $150"
