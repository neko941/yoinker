        "In these modern world, government expenditure is being used for more of their own purposes.",
        "the remaking of the old infrastructures in towns cost a lot amount of money from government.",
        "i would totally agree with the statement that more money should be spend on building new homes for poorer society and the improved road systems.This essay will discuss why agreed statement is much more  important than the remaking of old buildings.",
        "To begin with, the  governments have always vary about more the development in cities and major urban areas. because of these situations they forget about the poorer places and villages for instance, i live in a place which is situated in cities centre so i get my house renovated by municipalities whereas incase of my friend, who lives in an inside village he asks me to complain about the drastic infrastuctres there which are not even noticed by governments and the road not even connected to cities as its tough for him access good hospital.These are one case.",
        "This all drastic ways shows more of the goverments faultness.it should be changed by giving more developments to poorer societies and all the road growth,as by develeping more strong buildings and all bridges connected so that they can access to all the availibilty as for urban people.",
        "in conclusion , i would strongly argue that the goverments expenditure should be spend more on the facilties of small villages and less income socities rather than using it for deeveloping the more urban places."
