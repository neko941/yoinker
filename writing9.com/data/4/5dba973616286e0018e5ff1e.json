        "How can be resolved problems related to migration of employees to developed countries.",
        "Obviously, there are many reasons why people prefer to move out of  the home country. Firstly, most of the countries in the world do not offer adequate facilities to its citizens: social security benefits, infrastructures and minimum wages. Additionally, there is a less chance for career developments and promotions, even, they are qualified  for it. By contrast,  if these workers, especially, skilled workers, relocated to rich nations: the USA, the UK, and Canada will offer them with better career prospects and better living standards Finally, in many underdeveloped countries are severely affected with political unrests and corruptions. These all make people leave the country of origin for another destination for the bright future.",
        "This flow of migration need to be  prevented because this, otherwise,  contributes a series of issues. First of all, this brain drain creates a shortage of skilled workers in the society, which  affects many vital areas significantly. For instance, many training institutions may not find expert professionals to train their future generations.  Similarly, in many countries, they provide free compulsaoy education for children, this initiative requires a huge amount of investment However, these students do not work for the country, when they reach the adulthood, instead they migrate to other countries as  where they are  provided with  better job opportunities.."
