        "During the past few decades,contrary to popular belief,people enjoy more spare time than any other time.Some schools of thought maintain that leisure time ought to be spent on",
        "Enhancement of mind;conversely,others believe that free time is just for rest of mind.Despite valuable arguemements to contrary that will be elaborated,I am inclined to believe that the former opinion has conspicuous positive impacts on individuals and families.",
        "To begin with,having shouldered myriad job responsibilities,a vast majority of people are exhausted of doing mind stimulating activities.As e result,passive activities such as watching television,online shopping and so forth have become widespread throughout the world.Proponents of this trend declare that people would unleash their stress entirely and get ready to concentrate on their works and discharge their duties.",
        "Nevertheless, I would argue that the former notion is refuted to sone extent.In line with psychological aspects,allocating a separate time of hobbies to practice mind stimulating games provides a great opportunity to spend more time with family and children.It encourages children to be more intellectually active and make them more capable of drawing information.Further,surveys conducted by healthcare related organizations in recent years have proven that such activities as doing word puzzles and reading are crucial preventive factors to mental illnesses like alzheimer disease.It is ,thus,important for families to be considerate of actual activities.",
        "In conclusion,there remains some disagreements against my position;however,the preponderance of evidence indicates that, it is vitally important to focus on activities which improve mind during leisure time."
