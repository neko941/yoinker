        "Being able to travel to remote areas such as the South Pole is an advantage . I will explain my view in this essay .",
        "Travelling to various parts of the world has always been interesting for most people. With increase and advancement in technology, travelling has become a lot more easier. From riding on the backs of donkeys and horses to travelling by cycles than cars and trains and now finally by aeroplanes, travelling has become very fast. It used to take days to travel from one place to another, whereas now it takes only few hours.",
        "Due to increase in technology we are able to see many  undiscovered and historic places. Olden days when travellers used to discover new places they would share their experiences in the form of stories, and we would have to imagine it. Moreover , these days there are cameras which help us to capture those moments or even take videos of the areas. These photographs and videos can then be uploaded on the internet which makes it possible for many people to view while sitting in their homes or work place.",
        "A feature known as GPS is now installed in the mobile phones as well as in cars which shows you the route and time estimate to reach a particular place. Some of the natural environment in remote areas are still undiscovered. Travelling alone to unknown places is now possible with this feature. It helps you to reach your destination,even if you have missed your route. Modes of travel to places with natural beauty,south pole are now possible"
