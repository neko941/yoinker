        "In several countries,the number of flora and fauna are decreasing at an alarming rate.In my opinion,there are various reasons for these declining issues.There are many implementations required ,which can resolve this issue.",
        "To begin with,there has been multiple reasons for the severe reduction of plants and animals.",
        "Firstly,overpopulation is the major cause of this decline.The population in most countries is on the rise and it has a direct correlation with the environment.The increase in population corresponds to more space requirement for living,which leads to cutting of trees in substantial numbers.Also, the habitat of animals is being affected due to constant deforestation.Another reason for the reduction of species is the flow of industrial waste into the water bodies.It destroys the habitat of aquatic species.",
        "There are several ways to protect wild animals and plants.The first measure should be that the government should control the population as it is resulting in widespread destruction of forests.Secondly,there should a ban on hazardous waste deposits into the water bodies such as rivers and freshwater lakes,The higher authority should penalize the offenders.If we talk about individuals,they also contribute towards the protection of different species.They should plant more trees in their surroundings and become global citizens.",
        "In conclusion, the number of animals and plants are decreasing at an alarming rate due to deforestation and several other factors.The resolution of this issue will take commitment from individuals as well as the government."
