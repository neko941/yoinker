        "Along with the advancement in the technology, unprecedented ways of gaming have been invented to meet great demands from varieties of people, which leads to the fact that many ones have paid prominence of those games in the process of nurturing their offsprings. However, there are still ones having strong belief that conventional kinds of entertaining may be more effective on this ground. In my judgement, I agree with both those statement by virtue of some below reasons.",
        "On the one hand, with regards to the numerous benefits of modern games, like computer ones, children are sure to develop their cognitive skills. Many popular video games require abstract and complex ways of thinking to accomplish the give tasks, skills may not be taught through the old-day pastimes. To further clarify, children need to follow the instructions and solve complicated missions and use logic in many games, which will partly contribute to a children\u2019 progression into an adult. Secondly, the modern games can nourish the kids\u2019 sense of love and care. In current games, there are variously emotional plots added to the gameplay to attract more people, some of which can teach children about stories of life. For instance, a nominee for game of the year in 2015, \u201cThe last of us\u201d, is about a dad and his daughter have to struggle to survive in the world of zombies. They have overcome many challenges together to keep on living, which can educate children about the importance of love between kids and parents.",
        "On the other hand, old-school games are also significantly advantageous for developing such skills for kids. First and foremost, traditional games get children a closer bond because of the cooperation among them. Many traditional games require teamwork and how all the team members reach the goal together. One of the prime examples for cooperative conventional games is tug of war, in which people are divided in two teams, hold a rope to fight for the victory. In addition, traditional games brings about the extreme enjoyment for kids without at attaching them to new technologies. Children can hang out with their parents and friends, enjoying a non-tech childhood, which cause no serious disease for them in the future. Quite simply like that, traditional children\u2019s games stimulate their growth.",
        "To recap, it is completely undeniable that both modern games and traditional games originate a lot of positive effects on children. However, parents and children themselves should be aware of how the games are operated and how they would affect the children\u2019s life."
