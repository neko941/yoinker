        "Inspite of many advanced technology available in 20th century for an entertainment, people still prefer to stick with watching television in their free time. This is because of several number of program available in multiple channels. Also, climatic change is also one of the main reason for people prefer to stick with the television during their leisure period. In countries like, India, Srilanka, and middle east countries, temperature could reach upto 50 degrees. This makes people not to go out and sit at home. Which, ultimately makes them to watch programs in television.",
        "People started to feel comfortable by sitting at their own place, having food and watching programs in television. After one point of time, this makes them very lazy to go out. Most of the people, get addicted to this as it is more comfort to them. Some people, avoid going out with friends and families during the weekends in their free time. This makes them to miss their social life and project them as a loner. Some of the people, ends up in getting separated from their family because of the above said behaviours.",
        "In conclusion, television plays a major role in one's life. Its adviced to everyone, not to get more attached to it rather than spending quality time with friends and families. Spending quality time with people, gives you more positive energy and makes you to feel fresh."
