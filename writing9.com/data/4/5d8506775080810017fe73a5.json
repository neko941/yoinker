        "For the last few decades, family structure has changed drastically alongside with social value. It is apparent that the roles and responsibilities of man and woman have became more interchangable and euqal. In my opinion, this change not only liberate humankind from sterotypical gender responsibilities, but also enable a more flexible lifestyle, leading to a harmonious family.",
        "While it is unthinkable in 30 years ago that both parents would work full time, double income family has been the norm in most developed countries. This arrangement is beneficial to both parties of a marrage. Firstly, both husband and wife are free to pursue their passion and career goal. Nowadays, we seldom hear the story that a mother give up her dream job to raise her children. Secondly, the financial burban of whole family is shared more equally between spouses. Aside from being in a more comfortable financial position, the family would also be more safe financially if one party lost his/her job.",
        "In addition to financial responsibility, it is also common that houseworks and badysitting are distributed equally amoung two parents. Contrast to the old day that husband complaining his wife doing nothing at home, couples now understand the difficulties in maintaining a clean household. Moreover, studies have shown before that equally involvement from parent is one of the key aspect of a healthy child development.",
        "In conclude, I think the change of strucutre of families in recent years is overall positive. It enable family to build a better financial situation and facilitate a harmony inside every families."
