        "The university students should study the subjects of their own choice or they should be obliged to study career oriented technology and science major subjects, is a widely debated issue. I think at the university level, giving a student choice to follow subjects of own interest has far more benifits.",
        "On the one hand, the university is the highest citadel for education in any country and it is considered to produce a next adept generation which has capacity to lead the nation. Those who opine that the tertiary education should be students own choice based, they express that, forcing them to learn modern employment oriented study will make them become office worker, not the country's leader. But, letting them follow their dreams will build more confidence and increase the likelyhood of mastering the area they have choosen.",
        "On the other hand, recently, the progress of any nation is highly dependant on the availability of the scientific and technological workforce, and the university has the responsibilty to provide a nation with such workforce. So, the higher education institution has to consider it well before offering any range of courses to the students, they must know the consequence of path their study feilds will take a student to, and its future implications. For example, a syllabus bound student studies more enthusiastically and prepares exams well as compared to free majors students, in recent studies it is shown that number of students dropped out of university was highest among those who have choosen their subjects freely.",
        "Overall, pros of giving freedom to a unversity student to chose what he thinks best fit his dream overweigh the cons, so, if the list of courses offered by a university is well based on it futuristic application, offering students hold onto their liking is not bad."
