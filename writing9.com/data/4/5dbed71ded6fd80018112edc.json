The substantial influence of this trend has sparked the controversy over the potential impact in recent years . This essay will elaborate the views of favouring the positive impacts of  studding books for kids in the community and it's leads to a logical conclusion.",
        "First and foremost, they are myriad of reasons which will further  explain the arguments, but on the most preponderant one stem of the fact that is through book reading toddles can easily visualization the story and related to their studies therefore their IQ levels are increased a lot and impacted on their studies.
