        "Art is a self-driven skill that is built from inside the person and is born by nature but not by someone's promptness or suggestions. It is an inbuilt talent hidden in an individual and will come out after proper nurturing or exhibiting the such. Inecome a recent World, this is not much preferred as an essential tool but only as a side activity for time pass tool. Nevertheless, it has become an entertainment or passion rather than a compulsory path to livelihood.",
        "This is because of many reasons like less income, lack of encouragement, competition and many more. Besides, the opportunities are very less in number with too limited income, that results in poverty too. Payment received for arts doesnot fulfill requirement then again leading to jo, business and so on. Inspite of encouraging, people having creativity are being discouraged with unnecessary politics and reasons.",
        "Recent days, technology has brought drastic changes in science and culture too. Independent people are running towards self earning like own business run upon their ecstasy which helps them in leading life. Broad thinking and a clear understanding makes an individual feel the heat of te requirement of art. For example, ROBOTICS is being used widely by many organizations for automation of multiple methods of work. This is linked up with Science as it has to be performed by a ROBOT which, only Science can do. Although the object ROBOT is an output of Science and used for technology, it is the creative work of ART. Thus, ART is inseperable from other sources or modern means of living."
