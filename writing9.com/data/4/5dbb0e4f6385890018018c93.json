        "Rapid evolution in technology has impacted on human's consumptive behavior. The number of people purchasing things online (i.e., books, air tickets, and groceries) is increasing each year. Despite the disadvantages of this phenomenon, this essay agrees that there are more advantages to online shopping.",
        "Some people argue that buying things on the internet is causing more financial problems in society. In other words, as people could easily access online shops at their phones, they tend to spend more time on online window shopping and spend more money. Moreover, the marketing strategy always tries to lure consumers by making flash discounts, which makes people immediately buy their products without second thoughts. However, there would not be any problems for people with high self-control.",
        "Regarding the advantages, the growth of online shop platforms is in line with the effectiveness and efficiency of life. Firstly, people could save more time when they purchased things online. For example, for working moms, they could order groceries to be sent right in front of their door and save time by avoiding traffic jams or finding parking instead have more quality time with their children. Secondly, the internet has broadened the choices of things. That is to say, people could easily buy things which are not available at their local shops from other countries.",
        "Overall, shopping goods through online platforms offered  several advantages. Therefore, the benefits of online shopping outweigh the drawbacks."
