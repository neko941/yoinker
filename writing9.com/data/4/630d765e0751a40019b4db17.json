        "It is considered by some that several source of bread like doctors and engineers must be need to provide their service where they had done their study. While there are others believe that it is better to travel abroad. Although I think that it is useful to saying trained  country but I  do believe that travelled into foreign country is beneficial for certain  jobs.                                   First and foremost, many think it is working in the country where they skilled. This is one of the excellent way to demonstrate their responsibilities  to the country because of government provide education ,healthcare,economically support to make them doctor and engineer. Another explanation is that when they have left the country where they trained, the country get damaged economically  and socially. Finally, when highly qualified person like doctors and engineers and like  them, there are migrate  into different country it create professionally problematic situation,for example, when underdeveloped  countries  people immigrant into other country it result  in the loss of 10 unskilled  jobs,  which is a clear drawback for that country. On the other hand, having the opportunity to work other countries  make them more efficient and scholar because of, working with highly  standard people in develop  country which nurchur   their skills  and brush up there working  capacity. Secondly,  by migrating another  leaving place they can able to fulfill their dream, for instant, they enable  i to get standard salary,  lexious and secured life  leaving facilities. To sum up, despite the different views, I can be said that migration is useful for numbers of professional people like as doctors and engineers. Therefore, they ought to be independented to move whenever and where they wish."
