        "Online shopping is becoming increasingly popular among the city dwellers; therefore, it is predicted that the shops will be replaced by the online shops in future.I firmly agree with the aforementioned idea since online shopping offers far more benefits than buying things on shops, which will be elaborated in this essay.",
        "Firstly, online shopping allows people to save their valuable time.  As people need not travel to the market in order to purchase their necessary products, they are able to save the time, which they may spend on doing other crucial tasks. Take a working women for example, she will always choose to buy things online because she hardly manage time for shopping after a hectic day since she has some responsibilities towards her family.",
        "Secondly, the price of the products is comparatively cheaper online rather than at shops. A number of online shops, including amazon and ali baba, sell products at relatively low prices than those shopping malls in cities. This is because the online businesses have no maintenance cost such as rent or electricity bill for the shops; therefore, they can sell products and goods at a cheap price. As a consequence, people prefer buying things online to shopping centres.",
        "In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my opinion that online shopping will eventually replace the shops from towns and cities as it not only allows people to save time but also money."
