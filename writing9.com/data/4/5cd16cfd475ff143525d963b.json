        "As said, \"Knowledge is Divine\", by elders, it is an endeavoring prospect, an individual is blessed with, and which has no end to pursue. Earlier, only classroom tranings were available or home tutitions, whereas, in modern days, there are ample opporutnities with many online courses, through the internet connectivity, making people sit at home and learn before the desktop.",
        "These courses are made available online in almost all the fields of study like teaching, painting, drawing, cooking, Medical, General knowledge, current affairs, software manuals, and many more. The patterns of these lessons ae designed in such a way that, none feels there is no class room experience. Though some are recorded modules, while the others are live sessions with free web casts, pod casts, questionnaires, etc. Coming to web casts and live shows, one side the student accesses thorugh the user names and passwords, whereas on the other hand, the tutor or the mentor sits before camera, giving a face-to-face exposure while teaching the classes.",
        "There are many advanages as, not all of them can go to the realtime colleges or institutes due to numerous genuine reasons, despite this facility is awesomely useful to those individuals on higher note. For example, a physically challenged person can neither drive to long distances nor climb the staircase. Similarly, a pregnant woman, an aged woman above 35 or 40, person who has other medical complaints and so on. Obviously this is a handy tool for them to learn as much as they can and achieve their goals, in order to fulfill their dreams.",
        "Moreover, they are cheaper rates compared to the regular times. Also, the travel problems can be avoided consuming the time and money, furthermore, these can be utilized in other ways or purposes. In contrary to this, it is believed these are less effective due to loss of direct communication, at times, which is not true, but has lot of vast coverage of the subject in lieu of the requirement. Also, modern days, these distance education mode and the certifications as such, are recognized by companies in providing jobs too.",
        "So far as I believe, there are many advantages in learning through online rather than the disadvantages which are in diminishing count, comparatively."
