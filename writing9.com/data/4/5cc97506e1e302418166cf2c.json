        "Despite of great advances being made in the science and technolohy, their credibility in broadening the horizon of opportunities  for human is still controversial. There are several who opine that, a man now has a lot more options available to him than the man in old times. I personally agree with the idea, and I believ, changes in the transport, telebusiness and better health facilities are of paramount importance in this regard.",
        "Firstly, in any country, a well developed system of of transportation provides safe commuting for its citizen and for the businesses. Because, remarkable advances have been made in this sector, from high speed trains to international airlines, all provided people the liberty of choices, furthermore, it has brought the customer and the production units, the two ends of the business chain together, hence boosted trading. For instance, due to its magnificiently stretched rail system of China, it has mounted its economy to second largesr in the world.",
        "Secondly, a healthy community was being a dream to acheive by all nations around the globe. Fortunately, introduction of the vaccination, new antibiotics and modernized health care system has dramatically curbed number of fatal diseases. A healthy society raises a healthy workforce, vital for development of the country. For example, malaria has been a killer ailment in the pas,t but now it is fully treatbale.",
        "To conclude, although, every new inventions has some pros attached to it, but on bigger screen advantages of having more options outweigh its drawbacks."
