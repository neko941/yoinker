        "Let me explain my situation.  The trouble started yesterday in the morning. I shocked  in the parking place. Exactly it is third time mistake by someone. Add on to this, the bicycle is parked in the wrong side. So I complained to him three times, but I think he does not follow the parking regulation.",
        "I suggest you the parking area and  system, both are unsatisfied to all flat\u2019s members. So we can apply the penalty charge and if it is possible to build a new parking area of only the bicycle. Hence we can solve this issue at our destination."
