        "We are bounded by different relationships in the society. While the nearest circle is one's family members, neighbors represent an important influential factor in the quality of life. Some may argue that they can live within their home walls without any kind of effect from the surrounding people, whereas others account for what kind of neighbors will be living next door before moving to live in a certain district. To me, I strongly believe that supportive neighbor is the best to live next to, because he helps make life easier and happier.",
        "First of all, supportive neighbor helps overcome many unexpected life burdens. Living near people who care about you and willing to extend their hands offering help whenever it is needed, makes your life easier. Some good neighbors offer necessary help, just at the right time, ease the burden of sudden difficulties. My experience is good example here, when I faced financial difficulties due to switching to a new job, I could not fulfill my obligations to my kids' school.  School administration sent me a letter of warning in that regard and could not know what to do. At the moment I was thinking of selling some of the house furniture, my neighbor knocked on my front door. To my surprise, she was carrying a sum of money with a nice smile on her face offering to lend me until I settle in the new job. The helpful next doors are valuable assets in hard times.",
        "Secondly, good surrounding persons make our life more enjoyable. Even that daily life is full of complications and struggles; we might live in happiness and joy in the presence of supportive spirit among neighbors. Emotional support results in inner peace and calmness. I still remember how all of our residential square people gathered in our neighbors' house when their son had passed away. The poor parents have received deep condolences with high sympathy from all the neighbors which relieved them so much.  My mother insisted to stay beside her close friend, the mother, all the night.  We all shared them their feelings and worked hard to return the smile to their lips again. I strongly believe that the friendlier neighborhood means more happiness and quite life.",
        "In conclusion, the best neighbor you can have is the supportive one. With him you will face the challenges, and you will live more comfortable. Good peoples are those who involve themselves in their next doors difficulties to ease them and to make their neighbors happier."
