        "Arts having a distinctive place in the evolution of human history. In contemporary time, governments are spending money on arts in varied proportion while some people argue that it should be utilized for other better means. In my opinion, I strongly believe that the government needs to invest a balanced amount on arts.",
        "Building arts monument can help in developing robust intellectual society because it allows people to critically analyze the philosophical aspect of arts and advancing philosophical thought process. Arts contribution in developing the current world is enormous and ancient history had been depicted through artistic design, stone crafting and erecting marvelous monuments. For example, Egypt\u2019s great pyramid which shows engineering acumen at the same time artistic prowess for generations to learn. Arts help not only preserving the knowledge but contribute significantly in seminal hypothesis on subject. Even though some section of society argue that spending on arts is squandering the money, it helps in numerous way which we cannot realize it\u2019s monitory benefit instantly. One of the critical examples was from the painting of Mona Lisa by da Vinci which had attracted astonishing attention even after centuries with scholar articles, books and hypothesis are built in order to explain the painting; it is one of the critically discussed works done by any artist in the world.",
        "In my concluding remarks, I firmly believe that arts contribution in modern society far more advanced and we need to provide an ecosystem where it can be promoted, debated and supported in the best possible way."
