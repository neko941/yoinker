        "In the last few decades extreme sports have become more and more popular. Some people believe that these activities should be prohibited because they are potentially harmful. Whilst I largely disagree with the above statement, I have a number of reservation about this.",
        "Firstly, it is interesting to consider that 95% of people playing these sport do not get injured, whereas statistics say that the majority of accidents occur within the domestic wall, particularly the kitchen. This is considered to be the riskiest place in the house. Whilst most of people playing extreme sports are aware of the risks, often people who cook and cut food are not.",
        "Secondly, those who practice an extreme sport have a right to make choices  about his or her life. Banning sports like skydiving and skiing would be an unacceptable violation of their personal freedom.",
        "As I said, I only partially disagree because it is inevitable that what we decide to do affect other people. For example, it is clear that parents and friends of a skydiver could be worried for him or her. Moreover rescues are often expensive and an imprudent practice of extreme sports may cause more social costs.",
        "To conclude, extreme sports should not be banned, as this would be an infringement of personal freedom and an overreaction to the small number of people injured in this sports."
