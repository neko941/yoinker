        "Although subjects like mathematics and philosophy are important for an individual's interpersonal skills,it is argued by some population that these subjects are quite difficult , thus should not be mandatory for teenagers. However , I personally do not accord with it because these lessons are part of our every day life and have values in shaping future's skills and morals.",
        "To embark on , one of the primary reasons why these lessons are essential for children is that it would enhance the aptitude of youngsters and would help them to manage their time and money in a most efficient way.For example, mathematics would teach them basic calculations like additions ,subtractions ,multiplications and divisions which would certainly aid them in their daily routine life. Moreover , theorems like phythagoras is being used by civil engineers and architects in designing new buildings and structures.",
        "Another logic is that teenagers would learn about ethics and social well beings which is important for enhancing the communication skills like team leader , decision maker , language and leadership. To illustrate it further, philosophy teaches about moral values , reasoning and language ,thus stipulates the critical thinking of teenagers right from the beginning. So , it is essential that educators must teach these subjects in a creative and innovative method to engage offsprings effectively.",
        "Agglomerating all the points , it can be concluded that in order to develop the interpersonal and communication skills  courses like mathematics and philosophy should be taught right from the beginning , although some students might find difficulty while learning these subjects.Therefore, teaching methodology could change the mindset of children and their well beings."
