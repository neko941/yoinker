        "Immigration means moving from one Nation to the other for various purposes, in order to earn a better living or with a passion towards other countries. Now-a-days, this has increased a lot from almost all the countries, for the satisfaction of their means. The impact is breakthrough, in such a way that, in the last two decades, the demand is four times to that of the previous years. This is engrowing chapter which is very much essential for the growth of economy too, along with the foreign affairs in between the countries.",
        "While in such movement, people can learn the cultures and new customs that others follow. It helps in grasping distinct mentalities of people, their behavioural attitudes, improving the communication skills besides, education, adding an incremental degree to the career. It paves the way to find out unique job opportunitites, helping an individual to have ample chances of growth. This enriches once's financial enhancement, stabilizing their modest ideas of family settelement, at ease.",
        "On the flip side, we can learn new cooking styles, varieties of dishes, famous local cuisines, how they maintain their diet, etc., Moreover, the fashion differs obviously, from one's own country, which is explicitly noticeable, with the way they dress. Amazing wonders are seen due to changes in the weather conditions, making the view as scenic as possible, that any one loves to visit such places. Though, the climatic conditions are exaggerative, they give us ample time to settle down with subtle fitness.",
        "A good example of the above two scenarios is Canada, where the Maple syrup is widely prevalent althrough the country, but is not available at any other place. Like wise,  some other vegetables and fruits are available at cheaper rates, that a common man can rely and survive only on those. Few other things like the dressing, costumes and other materials that are worn according to the season are  adequately supplied at reasonable prices.",
        "I strongly recommend, that it is very much needed to migrate from one country to the other, indeed, would suggest to settle over there, if possible, and if time permits, to fulfill any financial or other sorts of necessities and also to enjoy their resources."
