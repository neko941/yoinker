        "Some individuals indeed do not excel in school yet succeed in their life.  Have we not heard of many stories of failure people who have stood out of the coud? While a few children fail during their schooling inspite of being intellegent, their dedication and hardwork makes them successful.",
        "There are few compelling reasons why a dull student makes an identity in the society. Firstly, the children might not be excellent in their acedemics but they are more practical and productive. Besides, a bright student may just byheart for the sake of exam but might not know the actual concepts. Secondly, the results do not matter as they are succombed to failures; however they imbed the strategies to learn the subject. The pre-eminent example is the CEO of Facebook, who is a University dropout, yet a well known entrepreneur. Finally, they tend to learn from the failures, which keeps them motivated. Subsequently, it makes them prosperous in the long run.",
        "Nevertheless, there are a few enthralling grounds which makes them successful. The dedication which failures carry towards their goal not only makes them rich but also helps create an image in the croud. Moreover, their attitude towards achieving their tasks makes them responsible to chase their dreams. While one is striving for the end result, the hurdles in between do not play any role for failures, instead the perserverance to reach the top creates history. A great example is Michael Phelps, who has worked hard in silence has amazed the world with a total of 28 medals in Olympics. Therefore, the commitment towards their goal makes them successful.",
        "In conclusion, although few people neglect their academic scores, I believe their zeal and persistence drives them to be one among the croud."
