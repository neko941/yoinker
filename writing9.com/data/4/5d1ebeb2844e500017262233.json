        "It is universally accepted that: in many urban countries, men still get the high-level promotions  even so women perform  a high percentage in workplace by nearly 50%. However, some people claim that:companies should be forced to give promotions for women, but in my opinion I strongly agree with that: high-level promotions should be filled by a person who is a workaholic regardless about his gender.",
        "I oppose the view and my reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs.",
        "First of all, there is no doubt that women live have changed completely.",
        "One can find  the gender roles do not cotroll on our lives as much as in the past.",
        "But that dose not mean women have the whole qualifications in their career.",
        "For example, police women can not be like police men even if they look more agreesive.",
        "So, the changes in women lives still need some support to get the qualifications.",
        "Secondly, people can not force companies and tell them what should do. furthermore, companis concept based on gaining more money, moreover if women can offer that they will give her more money and promotions.",
        "in addation, there is no denying that woman has a lot of works to do during her day \"cleaning, taking care of their kids \"",
        "that is why most of female work as a part time,whereas male work in full time.",
        "I belieced that is the main reason to giving men the pormotions.",
        "For instance, according to dely time, 70%of women work in part time jobs whereas the other 30% work in full time whithout their familes.",
        "As a resault, female should determine her job or her personal live, but her choice is \"family\".",
        "To conclude,it is commonly believed that companies should give women high-level conditons and promotions, but I wholeheartedly believe that this views should be changed, and focus on who is the best person to do his job sufficiently without thinking about his gender."
