        "In some countries like the UK, the elderly prefer to move into nursing homes. While some people are of the opinion that the government should bear the responsibility for paying for these services, others argue that the individuals family should be paying this cost. I believe that the government should fund nursing care services for people of old age for the following reasons.",
        "There is no doubt that there has been a staggering increase in the number of people surviving over 60 due to the advancements made in the field of medicine and an overall better healthcare system. Seniors often move to residential units for the old where they will be taken care by doctors and be able to interact with other citizens of their age. This also prevents them from burdeing their children who usually have hectic professional lives. It has been argued that the cost of living in an old age home should be payed by the immediate family of the senior citizen since they spend their entire lives decicated to making a living in order to support their families. However, not all families are financially stable to be able to afford the fees of the nursing home.",
        "On the other hand, the elderly have usually payed huge amounts of money in the form of taxes regularly and in turn the government should suppport them in their time of need. For example, in the US , productive citizens are making monthly payments for their Medicare insurance. When these citizens grow old and sick, the government needs to take charge to bear their health expenses.",
        "To conlcude, I strongly believe that while families can provide financial support to the elderly if they are able to , the government has greater responsibility."
