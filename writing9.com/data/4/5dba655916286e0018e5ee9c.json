        "Many people percieve that children learn better when they are placed in classes representing a diverse set, others however, believe that learning is enhanced when children are placed with other children of similar academic standing, that encourages quick learning and high chances of academic success, and I strongly side with this group.",
        "Clustering children with similar academic acbilities not only allows students to be agile learners, but also it improves their IQ levels. This is because surrounding a child with other higher achieving students stimulates an enviornment which is challenging, allowing mutual learning in a collective manner. Furthermore, each child becomes a positive reinforcement for his peers that encourages and fosters a positive outlook on academics.",
        "Healthy learning thus not only compliments higher IQ levels, but it also increases the probability of a child to enroll into high standing tertiary school.",
        "High achieving children create an environment for healthy competition, and thus if they consistently score high during their school years and continue to challenge themselves by going beyond what others are learning, they will probably succeed more than others.",
        "On the other hand, allowing children to learn with children with a diverse range of academic abilities improves a child communication skills and allows them to be considerate of others in all academic matters. Similarly, a diverse range of children encourages extra curricular activities, as some children are better in sports than others. Thus this promotes a healthy academic-physical balance in their student life.",
        "While having a diverse set of children in one class encourages physical activities and improves communication skills, I believe the benefit of having children of similar academic standing learn together is much higher. It encourages healthy learning and also enables these students to perform well throughout their academic careers which ultimately paves way for a good tertiary education and a bright career."
