        "Due to rapid boom in technology, food industries came with a new approach of convenience foods. The rise of these kind of foods has helped many people to move with the modern life style. Despite of busy schedule, one can grab a quick meal or food with them and can save time. On the other hand, one has to worry about chemical preservatives used in food to keep it fresh for long time. In my opinon, one has take care about food we eat rather than going with these kind of fast foods.",
        "To begin with, convenience foods are a trend in food industry because of instant food which were already prepared. This is because of the modern life style adopted by the people and helping them a lot to save time. For example, one of my cousion who is an entreprenuer and packed with work all day and does not have time to cook food but, convenience foods helping him in his modern lifestyle. Therefore, it is the go-to option these days.",
        "",
        "On the other hand, the disadvantages are more which will impacat in later stage of life. Some of the problems with this kind of foods are the preservatives used in it and the quality of the products. This is due to store foods for long time period. A professor at the univeristy of Sydney says that \" 40 percent of the people who consume convenince foods regularly are likely to suffer from cancer\". Therfore, one has to be aware of the preservatives used in it.",
        "The modern life style of people changed the food industry in many ways. Some of the advantages are quick to grab and  eat. As a result, one can save time. To the contrary, it is harmful to the people who consumes regularly. In my view, it is not advisable to go with this kind of convenience foods lifestyle."
