        "Now days pollution is a major problem causing major problems like global warming, depletion of ozone layer etc. The major reason for this pollution are the automobiles. Cars though have made transportation easier but it comes with lot of many disadvantages.",
        "Its been so many years since the launch of first car, but as time went by the number of cars on road started increasing in an alarming rate. In a recent survey it was found that pollution from cars contribute one fourth of entire pollution. The usage of car is also not efficient, car being made to carry 4 to 5 people but instead most of the time a single individual drives it which causes huge traffic and slows down transport.",
        "It is not just by exhaust that car pollutes, there are air conditioners fitted in cars which causes depletion of ozone layer. The coolant used in cars for AC's is the cause for ozone layer depletion.",
        "There are couple of ways through which this can be avoided, such as public transport should be easily accessible and made convenient. People prefer cars as a mode of transport because the public transport is not good and not properly maintained . Public transport such as metros, rails, buses should be more in number and should allow limited number of passengers to maintain comfort. Another reason is the fares of this transport, which can be lowered.",
        "Car pooling should be introduced, so no car goes empty and needy passenger can get lifts. People prefer using apps these days which will make car pooling easy and and effective way to efficiently use cars."
