        "Health is biggest wealth of people, but people normally doesn\u2019t realize its value until they face any kind of health issues. It is considered by many people that introduction of more exercise classes and physical education lessons in school curriculum is greatest way to solve problem of obesity and health issue. This essay will argue that why more physical education lessons must be certainly introduced in schools.",
        "Highly growing number of health issues like heart attack, blood pressure, diabetes is an alarming situation for the health department. Due to sedentary lifestyle of people, now a days people forget to do some kind of physical exercise, yoga etc. in their hectic time schedules which lead to increased number of health issues and also population of people suffering from obesity. For instant in India schools keep lectures of physical education only once or twice in a week which is absolutely insufficient to keep students healthy furthermore, daily physical education sessions will definitely develop interest of students in sports activity. Therefor introduction of more physical education and exercise in schoolings will firmly give long term and permanent positive results in health of students.",
        "Additionally this issue can also be solved by incorporating health measures in corporate offices reason being most of the people spent their major time at their wok place and if at work place itself few activities like heath check-ups, yoga campaign, cycling, etc. are conducted than it will also bring some awareness about health hygiene. For example some companies provide free fruit dishes, vegetable salads and proteins to keep their employees healthy and also organise body check-up once or twice in a year. However this method have not long and permanent impact as compare to bring awareness from schooling system.",
        "This essay argued that why physical education classes should be increased at schooling levels. I strongly concur my opinion that health awareness at schooling level itself is the best way to resolve health problems as it gives permanent and long term impact."
