        "On the one hand, a slight decrease of over 25% in the number of walkers was recorded for the period from 35% in 1950 to 10% in 1990; moreover, the figure for bike drivers significantly dropped from below 30% in 1950 to more than 5%. There was a dramatic increase in the number of car drivers from approximately 7% in 1950 to 25% in 1970, and then shooting up to a peak of nearly 37% in the year 1990."
