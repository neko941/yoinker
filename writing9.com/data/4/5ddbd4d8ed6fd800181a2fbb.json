        "People's way of seeing films has drastically changed over the past few years. Many people have now moved away from the traditional way of seeing films, which is by going to a cinema, to mobile phones and tablets. While they say that seeing a movie in their own personal gadgets offers a lot of convenience, there are still many who argue that one has to go to a cinema to fully enjoy the movie experience. Let's discuss both the views in this essay.",
        "If we think about the arguments from people who watch movies from their phones, we can clearly see that it is an unavoidable fact that watching movies in phones or tablets gives them a lot of flexibility. They can see a movie while they are on the way to their office. They can take a break from their work and see a movie for sometime to relax themselves. Simply, one can see a movie whenever and whereever he/she wants. Further, one does not need to spend a lot of time travelling through the city traffic to reach the cinema and can avoid the ticket expenses that will dug a deep hole in the pockets too. Both time and money are saved.",
        "The points from the other faction of movie lovers also cannot be easily dismissed. According to them, it is possible to get a true cinematic experience only if we see a movie from a cinema. Through mobile phones / tablets, one would not be able to see the picture quality or experience the sharpness in sound clarity. The big screen cinemas do have these advantages. Further there are a lot of people who still go to cinemas for this experience.",
        "Considering both views, I think it is a matter of choice between convenience and experience. Also not all movies will have a compelling story or graphics or art work that you would really enjoy watching in a theater. Therefore, in my opinion, we can rely on mobile phones / tablets for a vast majority of movies. But some movies deserve to be watched in cinemas."
