        "In today's scenario, from what I have observed is children are getting more freedom by their parents as compared to what I have experienced personally. It is an interesting development as it does have both positive and negative aspects.",
        "What I believe, freedom upto certain extent is great, as a child feels more connected with their elders and are open to sharing anything and everything they experience or observe. This way parents can always keep a track of their whatabouts and whereabouts which ultimately helps with respect to a child's security as well. When a child shares or wants to talk about any subject whether academically or personally, a guardian can show him/her the right path or approach regarding it, or can help by any other resources possible and available with them.",
        "Having said that, these days expenses have increased. Every now and then small toddlers want to go to some lavish place like resorts for day outings and overnight stay,  just for having fun without realising how much one has to spend on the same. Birthday parties have become a trend these days. Children from play school onwards want to go outdoor parties, movie theatres alongwith their friends which can become tedious for parents too.",
        "One most common boon and a curse is technology and electronic devices like mobiles, tablets etc. One cannot do without them as everything whether educational or uninstructive is easily available to everyone. While using it for benefits tags along its side effects too; most common being screen dependency disorder, which affects brain leading to poor nutrition, insomnia, eyesight problems at a very tender age.",
        "To avoid these issues, parents must constrict their youngers ones upto certain hours per week. If the hours are crossed, some infliction must be imposed, such as, cleaning their room, making  beds for all family members, cutting a penalty charge from their pocket money. Even the concept of pocket money has to be inculcated in them so that they learn the value of money, how to earn, when and where to spend.",
        "Freedom is sweet upto a certain level; too much of sweetness can even lead to diabetes. So I always believe prevention is better than cure. Required amount of freedom will help build a childs character strong and valuable."
