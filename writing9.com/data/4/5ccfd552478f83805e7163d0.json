        "Whilst, in some nations, museums and historical sites are less attractive of local individuals rather than to tourists. I will discuss about this, why this is occurring and put some solutions in the following paragraphs.",
        "To embark with, there are myriad reasons, why I am claiming that tourists more attractive towards art galleries and historical places than local masses. The first and important reasons, most resident have been growing up in there area and they have been studying from long time about there museums and historical places. Moreover, they think that these places are not running anywhere from  there; they have less interested to visit in that places. Furthermore, some people believe visiting far away places, which are much  different from their area; they can take new experience from that historical sites and museums.",
        "Contrary above to the statement, several causes can be taken to appeal native humanity to visit their local attraction. Promoting and introducing these historical places and museums in the television with the help of media;  which is good way for encouraging the local individuals. When local native watch these sites in television  commercial level, then local humankinds more interested about their attraction. In addition to, offering some free tickets for local citizens, they can easily visit their local attraction. Many mankinds belong to lower middle class families, they can afford to buy tickets. If it is free one day of the month for local humanity;  then more individuals attractive for historical sites and museums.",
        "To conclude, historical sites and museums to important for both local people and tourists. But some promotion and create new exhibition, the number of people visit historical sites and museums."
