        "In some parts of the United States, adults do not allow teenagers to leave the door after a particular time at night. In my perspective, this is true because teenagers are too young to protect themselves from strangers.",
        "There are several benefits to why keeping children indoors at night. First, when out in the evening teenagers are more likely to catch dangerous criminals. Criminals have many tricks to create traps for teenagers to dive in without being aware of their actions. They start using drugs are gradually addiction affects society. Moreover, criminals can kidnap and cause danger because it is dark so no one can help or stop their behavior.",
        "Second, teenagers who go out at night often gather with friends for drunkenness, and when returning home they can be at risk when driving. Besides, young people consume a lot of alcohol and they can fight when they disagree and easily lose friendship and danger to their bodies. Teens can not control themselves before their friends without their parents. So if kids want to go out at night they should bring their parents along to warn them when they cross the limits.",
        "in conclusion, preventing children from going out alone at night is beneficial for them. because they are small and not aware of right and wrong. So they need to be protected by adults"
