        "There is one way to reduce road safety is giving much more punishments",
        "I would agree with this statement, but there are other methods that could be also be used to improve it as imposing a stricter penalty.",
        "On the one hand, it is true that having a stricter penalty punishment and increasing the penalties for irresponsible drivers would reduce traffic accidents and improve road safety. For example, it is a fact that using a mobile phone while driving a car is a dangerous act. However due to the light punishment should the authority change the punishment into a heavier one, then people will consider twice befor they use the phone while driving.",
        "On the other hand, there is another method that the government could use in improving road safety besides having a stricter punishment. The gevernment could make a campaign about safety driving trough various media which would show the effect of careless driving. For instance, the government could make a safety video about road safety and upload it in social media since the message will be effectively spread in this kind of media. Then more people watch these videos, it is hoped that drivers will have a clearer view of safety driving.",
        "In conclusion, to a certain extent, I agree having a punishment would improve road safety. I believe that it should be supported with other ways. This ways improve road safety."
