        "Nowadays, with modernisation across the world, owning a car is more a necessity rather than a luxury asset. People prefer to buy a car rather to rent one which we will elaborate in the following paragraphs.",
        "Firstly, the reason why people buy their own car today is that it is practical, as it allows someone to drive safely with their family, wherever they want to go. Secondly, people are protected from bad weathers, attacks from thieves and high radiation from the sun as well. Obviously, owning a car is very expensive today  depending of course on  the models of cars. Apart the purchase of the car, people have to pay for car insurance, road taxes, maintenance  fee and petrol  which are consequently  very costly. The issue is when people owns his car, they will eventually use it to go to work and tha is the main cause of traffic jam.",
        "Inadvertently, not everybody can afford to have his own car, some people have no choice to travel by bus, trams and use their bicycles whenever they need to travel. On the other side, people they sometimes prefer to rent cars occasionally or on long term basis. However, renting a car is much more expensive than owning a car.",
        "In conclusion, I believe that having ones own  car is better than renting one. Nowadays, people are opting for electric cars which is less costly overtime. I do not agree to rent cars but some people have no other choices to rent one."
