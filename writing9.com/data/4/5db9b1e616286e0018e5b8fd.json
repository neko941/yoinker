        "Stress has become a major health issue which is happening due to longer hours at workplace. This essay will discuss about the reasons for stress and how employers can reduce it among The employees.",
        "The primary source of the stress is excessive workload and unrealistic deadlines which has become a usual thing in today\u2019s corporate culture.  The employees are being asked to work long hours to finish up the work which has been assigned to them with a strict deadline and when they are failing to meet the deadline, that gives birth to stress. What employers can do to eliminate this situation is to hire more work force or assign some work from overloaded employees to employees with availability.",
        "Another cause of workplace stress is the job security. This is a known fact that to survive in corporate world, one has have to perform exceptionally. Employees put in long hours to make a mark in organisations so that they can be considered as high performers which can provide some sort of job security. But many of the times employees fails to do so and that causes the stress among them. To help in this issue, employers should provide some counselling sessions to their employees which will help them in performing high and ultimately reduce the stress.",
        "In conclusion, workplace stress has become a common issue due to high workloads and uncertainty about job which can be dealt by hiring more people to share work and provide counselling sessions to the employees."
