        "Middle aged people in several countries are becoming increasingly disinterested in reading newspapers or watching daily news on televsion. This is due to several reasons such as advancement in internet technology and non-availability of print media. These challenges can be resolved if programs geared towards the youths are featured and money is provided to sustain media houses.",
        "Perhaps seem as the most important reason for lack of interest by young people in watching television and reading news from physical papers is the advancement made in internet technology. Youths are generally known to be upward and mobile and the internet presents a veritable source of information with all news available on a click, this is in contrast to the aforementioned sources of information that are not fast and mobile when it comes to passing across information. For example in cases of emegencies such as earthquakes, real time situation reports can be obtained faster online when compared to the traditional means of media. Besides, Most  companies that specialise in newspaper production and TV boroadcast are folding up due to low patronage thereby leading to lack of funds to sustain the business. Hence those who usually rely on these as source of information are soucing for alternatives. A study carried out in 2016 showed a 20 and 25 percent reduction in the number of Stations and publishing house respectively when compared to what was obtained a decade ago.",
        "However, the trend and be turned around by improving on the information available in news magazines and TV shows. Young men and women are generally known to love sports and if more sport features are encouraged in these means of communication,  youths will certainly get endeared. In addition, The government could also assist by providing grants and giving tax waivers help support the media industry, this will encourage more inovations that will seek for better ways of attracting teenagers.",
        "Conclusively, the improvements made in internet technology combined with low funding has resulted in reduction in the number youths reading newspapers or watching TV. Notwithstanging, this can be resolved if the contents of media houses are reviewed to attract middle aged people and funding is made available to sustain the traditional media industry."
