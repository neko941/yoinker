        "Food is an essential need for the homosapiens . Because of the variation in seasons for crops, it is important to store food with chemicals. Although these chemicals can be detrimental to human health, the merits in production and preservation outweighs it's risks.",
        "On the one hand, chemicals added to food either during it's production or preservation can affect human health. Because these additives are mixed with food products, so both the food and chemicals are consumed together. Even though the food is beneficial, so many people reacts to the added chemicals. To illustrate, chemical are added to beans for preservation over a long period of time. FDA reported that 80% of hospital admissions in North Carolina was due to consumption of the beans. It was  discovered that these patients were allergic to the chemicals. In addition, some of these preservatives are potential causes of cancer. As it was documented by German researcher, maize preserved with chemicals can cause Colon cancer.",
        "Therefore, prolonged exposure to these chemicals can result in ill-health.",
        "On the other hand, chemicals are beneficial for food storage and production. In the absence of it, our food will spoil. Because micro-organisms will have the opportunity to mesmerise with our food resulting in damages. For instance, additives are added to our perishables which are transported to other countries. If these chemicals are not added, the food will perish before getting to their intended destinations. Moreso, ability to use chemical products in production facilitate growth of crops. For example, fertilizers are chemicals added to our crops to speed up it's yield. Hence, it is beneficial in prolonged storage of food and acceleration of harvest time.",
        "In conclusion,  I believe the benefits of chemical used in food production and preservation outweighs it's draw backs because of the ability to stop microbes from spoiling our stored food and improvement in the area of harvest time."
