        "As the general trend is observed people choose big salary over job satisfaction, on the contrary In my opinion people who are happy for who or what they work for produce an output greater than those who do work that they are not satisfied with.",
        "Firstly I would like to say that no job is stress free , usually there is certain amount of stress associated with every profession out there and it depends on the people if they can put up with it. One of the reasons that people choose job satisfaction over high paying salary might be because they dont want to work under someone and be the bosses of their own, this is how a lot of people put up individual business after they have crossed age of taking risks and that is exactly how Flipkart an Indian e-commerce website was set up by 2 guys who were fed up with their \"nine to five\" jobs.",
        "Furthermore as i have stated earlier being happy with the output of the work is an important factor for people refusing jobs with a higher pay. As a lot of NGO's go a lot of their full time participants have quit their full time jobs and have begun contributing to the society in one way or the other. There are more than 2000 full time intrepid workers from isha foundation who have devoted their time and energy for the good of people. Their work in replantation of over 20 million trees has been revolutionary and has been actually helpful to public.",
        "So we can say that stress and the output of the work play an important role in someone choosing what or who they want to work for rather than just gong after a high salary."
