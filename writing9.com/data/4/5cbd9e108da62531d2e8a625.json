        "Extreme sport has gained popularity these past few years as one of leisure activities for those who love daring stunts. Although these type of sports can be exhilarating, it could potentially harms one's life. Some agrued that rescuers should not risk their life to save those in danger while participating in those sports as they must already realised the consequences of joing it. I have to agree with the fact that rescue workers should allow to choose whether to save or not.",
        "First of all, the individuals who join these events are already well aware of the consequences of these risky activities. They need to get permit for them to do these activities, therefore they usually experts or well-trained. Besides that, training procedures and life skilld are being taught to them in case of any alarming situation happened to them. It is their responsibility  to be aware of their situation and their risk of those activities. Rescue workers can only save risk-takers only if the situation doesn't place them in danger as well.",
        "Moreover, rescuer have specific SOP when they engaged to life-threatening situation. Despite of that, it is unworthy for them to risk their life ignoring the protocol just for the sake of adrenaline rush. There were cases where firemen died trying to save a man who bungee jumping without the safety belt. Imagine the faces of the family of the rescuer knowing he or she died just because of saving a person who careless with risking their life.",
        "To sum up, I strongly agree the fact that rescue worker have the right to engage rescue mission of these daredevils unless it is too risky. Altough it seemed ironic, but it is for the best interest for both of the parties."
