        "It is obvious we all get sick at some point as a human being. But now a days we can see there is a drastic increase of the number of people getting sick. Diseases can be categorised in to two, where as communicable diseases and non- communicable disease. There is a rapid increase in the number of patients of non- communicable diseases because of wrong food patterns, busy lives and many more reasons have led this increment.",
        "When the number of patients is getting high, the need for health service also rises at the same time. When we look at the world as a whle, there are developed countries as well as devloping countries. Regardless of the development that the respective country has achieved, there are a ceratin number of people who cannot afford for their medicine. So I highly agree with providing free health services in a country.",
        "When it comes to free health care, we must understand that everything cannot be given without a charge. There might be circumstances, where the patient has to bare the cost. But most of the day to day patients are not suffering from dangerous disease, which may cost high. When a person get cought to flue, sneezing, fever, or sort of sicknesses, it would be a great help  for them if they can get medicine without paying a single penny.",
        "One thing that I must highlight is, evenothough people do not have enough money to afford on expensive private channeling health services, mojority tend to go because of the service they provide. When we look at public health services, in most countries it is not upto the standards of private sector services. Less in cleaneliness, the manner they treat a patient can be seen as rude, likewise we can identify so many problems behind the scene. But what we must do is, charging a tax from the genarl public and have to allocate that whole fund to maintane the standards of public health services. At the same time have to incease the number of public helath service places, and should increase the quality of the service too.",
        "It is highly agreed that there can be instances where people have to afford for some expensive treatments, but as a whole the respective governments should incorporate to enhance public health service sector."
