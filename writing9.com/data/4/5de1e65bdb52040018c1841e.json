        "Dear Manager,",
        "I had lunch with my family a fews days ago and was not pleased with the food and service I received while in your establishment. I have decided to let you know about the somewhat bad experience I had.",
        "It is to my great disappointment having known your restaurant with high rating reviews which I can attest to having visited a couple of times over the past years, would encounter such unfortunate luck of been served with stale food with horrible taste. This not to mention the treatment I received from the server who was outrightly rude and unapologetic.",
        "I was displeased with the response I got from the server when I complained about the food served to me and my family. To my greatest surprise, the server said no one had complained about the food and maybe I just don't like the taste and they can not do any thing about the food. When I requested to speak to the manager, I was told you were not available.",
        "Anyways,  I decided to to write to call on your indulgence to ratify this horrible experience I had while visiting your restaurant. I would appreciate it if you offered my family and I an all expense paid lunch, a full refund of the meal paid for at my last visit, and also apology letter from the server who waited on my table.",
        "I await your swift and positive response. You can always reach me through my email or phone number 2234567878.",
