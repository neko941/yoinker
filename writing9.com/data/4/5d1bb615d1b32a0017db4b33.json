        "It is argued that languages undergo extinction yearly. Inspite of this, many people believe that this issue is not a vital one and also think that life will be easier if there are fewer languages globally. This essay agrees that having fewer languages will make the world a easier place to live in. This essay will discuss that fewer languages will ease communication amongst people and also reduce confusion and give a reasoned conclusion.",
        "Conversing with one another would be easier if languages available are few and easy to understand. Although, an individual would still need to learn the few other languages available in order to relate with another nationality but as long as the number of languages available are not overwhelming talking to one another will not be too cumbersome. To exemplify, during an international business fair in Japan, it was very easy for the facilitator to communicate with the 30 different nationalities because the major language spoken was English and french this would not have been the case if the facilitator had to tackle with a hundred and one languages.",
        "Despite the fact that fewer languages ease communication, it also reduces confusion amongst humans. One would be able to work or live in any part of the world without having to go through the stress of learning difficult and confusing languages. During the last world tour in Lagos where over 300 languages were spoken with over 200,000 visitors it was recorded that the tour ended up in confusion and caorse because paricipants could not understand eachother or the words spoken. The coach could only get through to about 2% of the crowd, thereby, leaving the rest in co nfusion. This type of situation would have been averted if fewer languages existed.",
        "To conclude, the world would be a better place if fewer languages existed as this would ease communication and reduce confusion. A great recommendation to the government is to limit only one language to each continent of the world to enhance flowability."
