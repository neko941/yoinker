        "In addition , they also help children to learn about their culture & history by learning stories related to it .",
        "On the other hand , generally these monuments require lot of involment of foreign people to build these monuments . This include from design stage to the development stage .",
        "Moreover we need to import lot of foreign material to build these monuments which can be very expensive & time consuming also .which can put lot of financial burden",
