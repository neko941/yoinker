        "In my opinion, Sports and exercise should be tha main factor in order for childrends to maintian thier health. Schools should not only be responsible for our childrens mental health and growth but also for keeping our childrens physical health under check.",
        "Obesity have become such a big issue in our world that every third person is suffering from obesity, not to mention the deseases that comes with it, such as, type 1 and type 2 Diabeties, Heart risks, cancer and so on.In our culture, Schools have just become a place where we think students should gain A* in every academic subject and think of physiical education as a secondary element. This thinking is just plain wrong and we need to take some harss actions inorder to overcome this issue.",
        "Teaching children about their health and how to maintine a healthy life style is pretty important in my opinion and this should it start in schools. Schools could conduct special assembleys inorder to teach the young students about the importance of exercise and sport. Schools could also organize different events inorder to encourage the students to play different sports and so on.",
        "But in my opinion, only increasing the time spend on sports in schools to solve this problem isn't enough. We need to do more inorder to fully take control of this growing situation. First of all, we can easily join hands with parents and show them that just by increasing an hour of outdoor activities can drasticly increases their childs health.",
        "Obesity is growing like a cancer in our world, taking hold of everything, rotting away the beauty of this world. This is a serious issue and we need to tackle it as soon and as severly as possible."
