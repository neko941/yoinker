        "Language is something we start learning from the lap of our mother. Some people believe, to learn any language properly, one must live in the country where that language is being spoken either as official or as native language. We are going to discuss, why I agree with the statement while analysing the oposite opinions as well.",
        "Language is not a subject, it is a process. Most of the languages have been evolved over centuries, not years or decades. Every language has it`s own norms, accent and pronunciation. There are rules and grammer critereas, which can not be taught using books or courses. Let`s consider French as an example, it looks similar to english in scripts, as both languages share many alphabets, even words, but these languages are entirely opposite to each other. Sometimes, we understand the meaning of a particular word, but native speakers use it in different context. Such rules of grammer and usage of words can only be mastered, if you live among the native speakers.",
        "Being bilingual is an additive advantage to anyone`s career or even personel development, and there are many people who believe that, learning any language is possible without even living in it`s country of origin. They consider language as a subject, and according to them, it is possible to be a professional in any subject, as well as language. A chemist is never born as a chemist, a mathematician doesn`t learn math in his mother`s lap, they all learn and become professional in their life time, hence similar path can be adopted for language skills. They further support their argument with examples of people, who have never been in a country but can speak it`s language proficiently.",
        "I think, language is not an open subject, it is usually an honour or pride of a country or tribe, thus no one can speak or understand it better than a native speaker. We do not need acedamic researches to establish this fact.  So, in my opinion one must communicate with native speakers to learn a language better, and what could be better than living among them."
