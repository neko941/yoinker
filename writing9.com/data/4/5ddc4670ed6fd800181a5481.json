        "Technology in the present day world has revolutionized services and products in almost all facets of life and  the education sector is one of them. It is often argued that it is a positive development while other states that it has devastating consequences. This essay agrees that an increase in technology is a positive aspect and is extremely beneficial to the students. This essay will discuss both points of view.",
        "Computers have aided the school curriculum to a large extent. Teachers are not only one, who are enjoying the benefits of it but students are also taking the advantage of it, as it is making their study easy and entertaining with the help of visual effects. Therefore, technology is referred as a worthwhile tool in classroom. Accessing information beyond geographical borders with just one click is a prime example of computers serving their motive in classroom.",
        "However, an argument is being put forward by some short-sighted people that face to face interactions has came to an end and is bringing devastating consequences in the field of education. People often say that the mind of children are more vulnerable and impressionable, which puts them into a risk, if they are not in a contact with a human teacher. Moreover, computers brings internet and internet brings scam. More exposure and time with computer can make children a prey of scammers that can deviate them from their study path which will further lead them to acquire unethical modes.",
        "To recapitulate, negative consequences of computers in field of education has some credibility. However, without computers making children learn is not an effective way. I opine computers plays an integral part in education sector with adequate measures we can certainly minimize its drawbacks and optimize benefits."
