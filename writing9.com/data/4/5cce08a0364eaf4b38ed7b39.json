        "Recently there has been an increase in the trend of students studying overseas as part of their degrees. Despite the high cost  of tuition ,the quality of education abroad is more advanced. In my opinion studying abroad is far more rewarding and will benefit the individual despite the cost implications.",
        "The major advantage of studying in a foreign land is that the quality of education is more advanced and stand to learn a lot  as compare to what is obtainable in their country. This is possible because foreign universities have advanced technological tools for learning and students are more exposed to research materials.For example doctors who do their residency program in Russia have more exposure and better experience because sophisticated equipment makes them better expatriate in the chosen field of specialization. This in-depth does not just benefit the individual intelectualy but also makes excel in their career.",
        "The main challenge of studying in a foriegn is the cost of tuition in tertiary institutions,  which is most times ten times higher than what they would pay in their country. For instance when I went to India to in pursuit of my master degree, I paid ten time as a foreigner as compared to indigene. In addition to high cost of fees, the cost of living is also very expensive. This made me take up a part time job so I could could assist my parent in paying the fees and settling bills for my day to day needs.",
        "The number of students studying abroad as part of their degrees .is on the increase. Despite the high cost implications, the reward  of  studying overseas  is worth it."
