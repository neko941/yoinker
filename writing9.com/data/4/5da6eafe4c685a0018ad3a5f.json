        "It is quite evident that consumption of unhealthy food is rising among many countries. This growth also increasing the masses suffering from health disorders. However, a section of thought believes that it is essential  for Government to restrict this by imposing large tax on junk foods.",
        "To my mind, imposing a large amount of tax on fast foods should restrict the local people in some limit. For example, a burger of 80Rs. should charged with extra 50Rs. of penalty should be cost Rs.140 which should quite hard to consume daily for middle class population. Furthermore, high penance also affect the selling rates of junk foods. For instance a restaurant earning little income find very difficult to pay a large amount of tax.",
        "On the other side, it is individuals own responsibility to decrease the intake of unhealthy foods. People must be conscious about their health and consume the food containing nutritious values. To site an illustration, family have to plan a proper balanced diet chart and try to follow that strictly. Moreover, population must be aware about the hygienic level of food they eat.",
        "Instead of imposing high tax, Government should have to rise the number of physical fitness centres in locality. Along with it, there should parks with free yoga classes. In addition to it, Government have to arrange some seminars which provide information about the diseases caused by consumption  of fast foods and also delivers lessons about importance of healthy food.",
        "T pen down saying, it is Government responsibility to take the matter very serious and some strict actions. However, it is also individuals personal concern about their health keeps them away from unhealthy food but Government concern should be more proficient."
