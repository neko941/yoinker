        "It is rare these days to find someone who does not use the cell phone or the internet to react other other. Although, the broad using of these technology, I believe that the drawback of this development outweigh their benefits.",
        "One of the main disadvantage of cell phone and internet socially is the affection on the human personality due to speak behinde screen or using cell phone hide some of social communication skills and promote some bad benefits such as shy whereas the face to face remove this kind of barrier in speaking .In addition, some people show all the details of their life on social networks Facebook, Snapchat; consequently, exploit that information in wrong way. Furthermore, this connection may cause misunderstand in some matter between people which mainly not occurred in face to face communication because in the last ones peoples can discuss more to clarify the idea and presence of language body help too.",
        "Despite of this disadvantages, there are several important advantages. Firstly, the internet and cell phones help people to stay contact with persons who love regardless of the distance between them and time so, give them a chance to make new relations .Secondly, parents by internet and cell phone can keep in touch with their children who are on holiday.",
        "In conclusion, the technology including cell phones and the internet is like weapon with two sides .we should aware about the pros and cons to develop the society positively."
