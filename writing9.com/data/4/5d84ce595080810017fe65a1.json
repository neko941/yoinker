        "Over the last few years,there has been increasing in the number of people travelling to hostile places. Tourist could get enjoying adventurous trip and there may be some disadvantages to this trend and i will discuss both in this essay.",
        "To begim with there are many advantages to visitig the remote areas. Firstly, tourisim strengthens the economic conditions of such places. with more and more tourist visit in a country the better the economy grows multiple.",
        "For example,many roads and hotels were build in remote areas these facilities used by locals and as well as it is also helpful for travellers and hence it helps in enhancing the economy.",
        "Secondly,if one wants to enjoy the beauty of nature closely then he needs to needs to go through some troublesome ways. Like,to see  animals of Amazon jungle one has to stay in woody areas for couple of days without using of modern facilities.",
        "On the other hand ,travelling to such places like Sahara desert and antartic has its disadvantages too. Firstly, local peoples find it difficult to to share the natural resources with the tourist that already very in low content for instance, water is already in very low quantity in the desert areas and with more tourist visit such places it become really hard for locals. And visiting Antartica, its life challenging to travel to such places because its very coldest continent.",
        "To sum up, if many tourist travel in difficult areas, travellers will also effect as well as the locals",
        "also find difficulties to share their natural resources. In my opinion, the positive aspects of visiting dangerous places like Sahara and Antarctica outweigh the negative aspects."
