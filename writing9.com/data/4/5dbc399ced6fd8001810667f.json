        "There is no doubt that the rate of crime had increased in the past century to an extreme level.Each Year, the crime rates is significantly higher than the previous year.Most of the people think that the main reason for the violent behaviours of the communities is media, on the contrary, others believe that poverty and lack of education contributes to this cause with much more.",
        "Firstly, if we have a look at Social Media, Movies and video games, It is clear to everyone that all the content includes violent actions and behaviours which makes aggression socially acceptable leading to higher crime rates.On the other hand, the majority think that",
        "poverty and the need for life essentials such as food and shelter has much greater infuence on icreasing crime rate and criminals.In my opinion media,poverty and lack of education are all on the same level and must be tackled and treated by the governoments.",
        "More over, lack of education is one on the main reasons of developing ignorent personals whom they dont yeild to any law.By default those whom are not educated will tend to have no jobs and accordingly no income or means of supporting their way of living, hence due to poverty and the need of surviving the crime rates will increase.",
        "Some say that providing proper education to the young ones and teaching them from a young age will help them have self diceplne and accordignly self control , leading to a better lifestyle and accordingly decreasing the percentage of crime in those generations.However the rest",
        "still insists that the problems coming from the media side is much more seveir as nowadays , technologies are reachable and accessable for everyone and they are",
        "the main reason for the aggression in the society.",
        "In conclusion, wither its media,lack of education or poverty , they are all essential contributers in increasing the crime rate and governoments must",
