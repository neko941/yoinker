        "In some countries buying throw  internet is taking over the traditional shopping.",

        "From running to go to work, after that going home, cooking and spending time with our family is not much time left to go to the shops and trying to buy all the shopping that we need. For this reason more and more peole find it easy to just shop online and everything comes directly on your door step.",
        "Secondly doind your shopping online gives you the chance to check the prices and even compare them, and even finding a lot of discounts.  As a example I was looking to buy a new laptop and trying online I descovered that in one place,  currys  were selling the same product with 30% less that what I saw on argos.",
        "Hence , sometimes is better to look and shop online but there are times when shopping online will waste your time and money.",
        "On the other hand when you go and buy directly from the shop you have the chance to see the product, to check it and even to try it. Such as clothes, you can order online, but it can not fit you or even the material si not what you wanted, and is much better to buy direct from shop as you can try and check them.",
        "Overall there is  personal choice how we buy and is more about the time that each of us alocates to shopping."
