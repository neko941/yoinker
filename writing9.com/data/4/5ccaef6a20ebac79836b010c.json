        "The discussion of whether young people nowadays should be taught to be good parents and what skills needed to be ones will be presented as below.",
        "Firstly, raising a child nowadays is much more complicated than 15 years before because with the advance of society, parents are expected more, specifically to not only provide their kids with sufficient basic needs such as food, shelter but also help the child to realize his/her potentials and show enough affection, love and guidance. Henceforth, youngsters need training about parental skills, which do not come naturally, so that they are prepared to give the best to the future children without, hopefully, too much trials and errors.",
        "Secondly, the opportunity to learn about parenting would make young people better themselves. They will be more understanding and empathetic with their parents because once youngsters are aware of the hardship their parents encounter when bringing them up, they will make an effort to be worthy of that parental love and be a good child. Additionally, this type of education on how to be a good parent will develop a sense of responsibility towards youngsters because they realize that one day, their babies will need to count on them, and they will be the first and foremost example for these little humans to look up to so today\u2019s youngsters will be more mindful of their actions.",
        "Parental skills are numerous and also vary accordingly to situations. However, I strongly believe that one of the most important functions as a parent is to help your child to learn, and support their learning. This serve as an end to help your children realize their potentials, no matter what it is. It is such a shame that some skill sets of children are neglected just because those are not commonly viewed as talents.",
        "Another crucial parental skill is understanding and communication. This means that youngsters should be taught to learn to view things from different perspective or in another word \u201cto put himself/herself in another\u2019s shoes\u201d and to communicate effectively to resolve disagreement. Since people sometimes assume that as a parent, you have the privilege to be always right and to yell at your child when disagreement occurs. This is not an effective upbringing method because your children are deprived of the chance to voice their opinions, and gradually become distant with you.",
        "All in all, I believe that the education of parental skills is much needed in this modern day. It will benefit firstly youngsters and their families, and generally to the whole society because every family is the core of society."
