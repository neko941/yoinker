        "Industrialistion, nowdays has burgeoned at a rapid pace, leading to an enormous rise in the pollution. To this situation, certain section of masses opine that these industries should be heavily taxed, while others believe that there are more enhanced ways to tackle the pollutants caused by factories. This essay will discuss both the views before coming up with an logical conclusion.",
        "On one hand, the idea of taxing factories can cause a fear in the minds of the owners that if they are discharging any kind of hazardous waste out , they will be penalised in form of hefty taxes. Eventualy, the tax will put a toll on their profit margin, eating a large share of their earnings. Hence, they will develop efficent working conditions in order to reduce th pollutants being disposed out. To illustrate, Uttrakhand, a state of India has imposed 30% tax fine to regional factories for dumping waste in the river Ganga.",
        "On the other hand, some people wants that industry should adopt efficient ways of working like use of renewable energy sources and eliminating the traditional ways of burning coal that causes carbon emissions into the air.",
        "They can install solar plants to generate electricity and any kind of heating process. Moreover, dumping of the waste should be thoroughly examined and treated so that it do not cause any harm to the biodiversity. Swtiching to eco-friendly raw materials can therefore help in reducing harmful waste causing pollutants",
        "According to my perspective, taxing cannot help in lowering down the pollution rate as factories having high turnover revenues would not get affected by heavy taxes, whereas if they start adopting eco-freindly practices like insatlling solar boilers and use of sustainable raw materials would impact more positively. Consequently, they can be rewarded by the government for this kind of contributions towards society's betterment.",
        "To conclude, it is clear that focusing more on imposing tax fines on industries, they should be encouraged to adopt sustainable trade practices for diminishing pollutants and saving the mother nature from degradation"
