        "In 2007, the city hospital was in the center and the ring was all over it. The hospital artery connected the city artery with the ring course. There were six bus stops on hospital rd three on each side exactly and can park: staff and public were also placed on the eastern side of it.",
        "Letter on 2010, There were a lot of changes in access roads though the ring highway remained untouched Hospital rd was introduced with two circle type roads called \u201croundabout\u201d, one was in the joint of the ring road and hospital rd where another one was in the joint of city artery and hospital rd. Right-side bus stops were replaced by a bus station. Car park: staff and public, were spitted into two different car parks, one for workers and the other for public. Staff can place was remained the same position of the previous car place, but public car park moved next to the ring course."
