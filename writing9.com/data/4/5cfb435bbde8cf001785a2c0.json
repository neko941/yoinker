        "People had different opinions about working at the same organization or different. People thoughts are not always same, it totally depends on their working conditions. For some reasons it is better to work in same place,while there are negative impacts from it also. This essay will examine the various reasons and the consequences of working in the same organizations.",
        "The main reason to change the working place is strong desire to have a salary growth and also to learn a new knowledge. A lot of people think that by changing the organization they will receive significant rise in income, but it may not be true in all conditions. There are some people who receives highest package working at same organization than others,who keeps on changing frequently.There may be chance of getting promotions as they have complete knowledge about the company.For example, consider one person who is working in some company for almost 10 years, they have huge experience and able to solve any problem quickly than the person, who also had about same 10 year experience but working on different places.There will be disproportionate burden of company to aquire new employees and to train them.",
        "However, working on same organization also had some difficulties. Consider the person who is working in same place, their knowledge is limited only to that company. But the person who had worked on different places, has lot of experiences on all the companies. They learn different things and capable of adjusting to all new places.They are habituated to learn new things very fastly and sharing their experiences to others in company.",
        "In conclusion, I think that people move from their work place to have better working environment. However, the change may not always meet people's expectations.",
        "So, it is important to consider all the possible outcomes and decide whether leaving your working place is worth it."
