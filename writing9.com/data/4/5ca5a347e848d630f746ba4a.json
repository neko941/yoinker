        "-\tReplicability: It refers the act of repeating things for another time in order to avoid the error which was done at first. This will be achieved through preparing research materials for instance, and revise them a couple times to ensure the accuracy of what is meant to be in the search tools. Also, replicability will be done during data analysis phase, where transcripts will be written carefully and rechecked another time, and when they are being used.",
        "-\tStandardization: This process involves having data that are conforming to a certain standard. This can be realized through creating standardized search tools, for instance standard questionnaire (Verhoeven,2015) in order to acquire the exact information that is needed. This will be achieved through preparing for instance interview questionnaires beforehand to assure that the topics that need to be investigated are all introduced and are asked in the most appropriate ways.",

        "The second variable of credibility is Validity. It refers to the level in which the research is free of systematic errors (Verhoeven,2015). Systematic error occurs as when the respondent is intentionally giving the wrong answer. This can be done due to the type of topics or personal (Verhoeven,2015).",
