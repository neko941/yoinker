        "Nowadays, computers are smarter than humans , even if humans invented it, but now the technology is taking all of our missions and the computers are the principle of all what technology can do.",
        "Another fact to consider is that computers helps us to complete our projects , as well, it makes our life more satisfied with things that probabaly will be harder without computers and it technology. In addiction imagine that if all the data we have can't be kept in the computers... what will happen and how it will be reflected to our life.So we have to appreciate the technology of computers and how it is developed .",
        "Furthermore, the computers in how it works is so complicated compared with humans brain . so we can't get what computer can do. Because our brain is not programed as computers ,so we don't have skills to do more than one things or more at the same time .",
        "Perhaps the most ineresting thing about computers and it technology is how it can do a lot of misstions at the exact moment.",
        "Beside of thatAlso , computers can minimize our waste of time, like if we want to read a book we go to libraries and spend a lot of our time finding the book we want to read , so with computers we can seartch about whatever book we want and can find it in less the mintue.",
        "And that's why I agree with the statement above that says computers are usually in struggle to be the most interesting and important invention in the whole world of the last centuries ."
