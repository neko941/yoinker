        "The chart illustrates the changes in the percentages of five primary occupations in Canada between 1850 and 2020.\u2028 \u2028Overall, the most popular career for Canadians was servicing during the period, while energy and water took the last place. It is witnessed that the proportion of manufacturing, agriculture/fishing and energy/water exhibited downward trends over the years, whereas the other workforces such as services and construction showed rises.",
        "Canadian workforce\u2019s rate for manufacturing was 36% in 1850 when taking the lead, yet the number experienced a sharp decline which was left one-fourth(9%) in 2020. Next came services, one-third of the labour force can be seen in 1850, and rose significantly to more than 80% in 2020, outracing the previous proportion and seeing the greatest growth among the five employees.",
        "The figure for agriculture/fishing was ranked third, at 22% in1850. However, it hit a low point of only 1% at the end of the period. It is also worth noting that the number of construction was 5% in 1850, then it went up by 3% in 2020. Energy and water in Canada was the least popular career in Canada, at 3% in 1850, then dropped to 1% in 2020."
