        "Most probably the greatest invention of past couple of centuries is computer which is serving as a kind of personal assistant for majority of us, as well as playing pivotal role in running all sorts of official purposes, ranging from minstry to research academies. This essay predicts about probable upcoming applications of computer, also presents a comparison of positives and negatives of relying on this device.",
        "If I had to assume that what more computer can offer for next decade or century, I would say that all potentials of computer have already been discovered, we only can expect to have access to amazing applications which are still not comnon to serve individual's purposes. For instance, we are using computers to diagnose diseases, predicting weather and creating better artificial intelligence, but commoners can't enjoy these luxury in daily life. May be future will make things easier for us by allowing wider access.",
        "Some people find it ominous that we are consumed by computer. They fear that in long run it will degrade our natural lifeskills which we aquired over thousands of years of civilization. Another dreadful worry is the consequences if computer fails us someday. According to them, we might lead this world toward a jeopardy by practicing getting things done with computer and giving up manual skills.",
        "Despite this horrifying vices, computer's positives are countless and so wide that the vices it creates make only a minuscule of its vast effects. Civilization began its ascent thousands of years back, but gained momentum in true sense after the invention of computer. Now we are connected through internet, we can communicate and commute at a great speed as we had never before, and most significantly, we can think at a global scale.For examole, the world is fighting with global warming together, and computer made it possible by connecting the world leaders and providing sufficient data and other aids. Computer and technology made it possible to fight with fatal diseases, conquer the space. Furthermore, it keeps us entertained, also improves us in many ways, both directly and indirectly.",
        "In fine, computer is a blessing, and even all the negatives peple can think about computer hypothetically do not make a match for a single benefit of it. We should embrace the advatages, also be prepared to overcome the threats."
