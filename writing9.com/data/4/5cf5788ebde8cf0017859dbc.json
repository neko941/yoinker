        "Government should invest more money on prevention of diseases rather than on treating them as the former is more important. I agree with it partially, because prevention is more beneficial than treatment, but every disease cannot be prevented.",
        "It has been said that prevention is better than cure. Today there are many life-threatening diseases  and government spends huge amount of money to treat them.But if same money is utilised in preventing such diseases, today there would have been less number of such cases and government could have spared lots of its resources comparatively..For example, hypertension and diabetes are the major diseases in almost all countries of the world, for which every nation spends almost around 30% of their healthcare budget.If that money had been used on preventing such diseases, there would have been less number of cases and more savings.",
        "On the other hand, there are handful of diseases which can not be prevented.In such cases treatment is the only option. For instance, genetic disorders like Alzheimers disease, Huntington's chorea and many more. Such diseases will definitely be transceded upon deiseased offsprings.So, in such cases  treatment is the only option and government will have to spend mone on it.",
        "In conclusion, I partially agree that  government should spend more money on preventing diseases rather than on treating them as the former is more beneficial, but there are some diseases for which prevention is impossibe. And treatment is the only option."
