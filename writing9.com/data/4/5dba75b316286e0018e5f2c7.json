        "Railways is a form of public transportation that helps mass transportation of people over long distances. Now-a-days, governments are contemplating on spending money on railways than roads. However, in a world where people prefer travelling alone, is this appropriate, is a question to be answered.",
        "Firstly, mass transportation systems, like railways, help save fuel. With every passing day, oil and fuel prices are increasing tremendously. People end up paying almost half their salary for fuel for their cars. However, railways helps reduce fuel consumption and are much more cost effective.",
        "Secondly, in a world where climate change is taking a toll, promoting railways helps reduce pollution. Private vehicles are one of the major causes of air pollution. Studies show that more than 30% pollution is caused by cars. By promoting railways, this can be overcome, as railways helps people commute in masses.",
        "Thirdly, travelling by rail, is not a costly affair. Even the underprivileged sections of the society can afford to travel by rail. This helps reduce the gap between the rich and poor in a society. However, critics of railways argue that this mode of commutation does not provide door-to-door service. Also, rail tracks cannot be laid in mountaneous areas.",
        "To conclude, although railways may have its pros and cons, it is the need of the hour. Though the government should not neglect roads, I agree that government should spend its resources on railways instead."
