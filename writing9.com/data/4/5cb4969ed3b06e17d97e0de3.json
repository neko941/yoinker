        "In any underdeveloped country, providing the good health, education and trade is essential for the development.  Industrialized countries should take the additional responsibility of developing these sectors in the poorer nations. I completely agree with the statement, it will be a long and tough road ahead for less privileged countries to take on challenge on their own, receiving the external help is the best way forward.",
        "Poorer nations often lack an expertise and determination to establish the guidelines for the development of any sector and of course funds deficiency hinders the growth plans. At the same time, the poorer states should acknowledge the underlying problems like corruption and mismanagement of the resources. There are many countries on earth that are rich in the natural resources, yet they struggle to provide the daily needs to their citizens, poverty will go nowhere until these fundamental issues are addressed.",
        "Developed nations have to work with the responsible authorities and NGO\u2019s in framing laws that brings in accountability into the government workforce. If the concerns of poor nations are not addressed, it is going to have a ripple effect on the advanced countries. People will try to migrate either legally or illegally to the other states in search of better life and many people might lose their lives on the way. In recent history, hundreds of people died while trying to illegally migrate to Europe from the Africa and middle east.",
        "To conclude, I agree at that the developed countries should take more responsibilities in the development of poorer nations. It has to be collective effort, not limited to either one of the sides."
