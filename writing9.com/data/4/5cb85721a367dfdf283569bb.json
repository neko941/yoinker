        "Fast, and safe transportation systems are two key aspect for the develpment of  any country. Every govenment spends on its citizen to cummute safely and quickly, businesses also rely on solid transportation system. When a questiona arises about whether a government should spend more on rail or roads, people seems to have devided opinion. I personally beleive that, governmet should focus  on railways.",
        "Firstly, rail offers safe commuting both for the citizen and traders, traffic accident and highway casualities in many countries are far higher than rail casualties, thus spending more on safe way of travelling is more prudent idea.Also, rail cause less environmental damage than road vehicles whic are main source of pollution around the world.",
        "Secondly, a train can carry hundereds of people along with hundereds of tones of goods, while road transport can only carry a few. Some shuttle trains are much faster than a car or public bus, hence saving valuable time of people everyday. As the population of the world is increasing tremendously, we need safe and reliable means of transportation to reduce traffic congestion in mega cities and curb the problem of pollution.",
        "To conclude, I believ that the governments, either in the developed or developing countries should pay more attention to attain comfortable, cheap and fast mobility, and railways system offer these all benefits. So, I strongly agree with the idea of spending more money on railways rather than roads."
