        "At the present time, technology evolution has arrived to monitor what society is constantly saying and doing with people unawareness. In fact, people movement and decisions are being observed by security cameras and cellphone tracking systems. The advantages of this development definitely outweighs the disadvantages and this essay will adress the reasons for this.",
        "On the one hand, there are mainly two advantages of being observed and tracked continuously. Firstly, security cameras videotaping can certainly protect shops and malls from thieves. For instance, many clothes shops have installed security cameras at the entrance and around the dressing rooms in order to prevent that clients still goods. Secondly, tracking systems can help recover lost or robbed objects. For instance, cell phone users find their device by going online and loging in to their account, this way while the telephone is still on it allows the system to give the location of the object quickly and accurately. In summary, the advantages of security and tracking systems are nowadays necessary tools to overcome mainly comercial and personal thefts.",
        "On the other hand, the disadvantages of being watched and heard all the time should certainly be taken in mind. Firstly, private information can reach places the user is unaware and did not allow consciously. For example, many cellphone applications ask when being installed, if you agree that it will use the camera and access the contact list. It is to say that the application will access to personal information permanently without the user noticing. Secondly, tracking systems can be notably annoying for teenagers who does not like being found and watched at all times. In spite parents enjoy being aware of where their children are at all moments, this situation leads to discussions in the family regarding confidence and trust.",
        "In conlusion, at present, continuous development of technology has reached a place incredibly positive for society. Whereas private information distribution and access can be felt of easy access by many, security improvements certainly outweigh this dissadvantages."
