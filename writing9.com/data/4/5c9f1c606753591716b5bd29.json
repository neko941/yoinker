        "Opinions vary on  whether or not museums should be free for visitors. I can understand there are some positive effects, however, I am of the opinions that the advantages are eclipsed by the disadvantages.",
        "It cannot be denied that there are some benefits to some extent. One of the major points is that the admission charging can bring a great deal of money which operate the museums . Without these funds, the museums cannot be cleaned and maintained rather than they have the funds from government or other organizations . Another point is that the museums have enough budget to broaden their antique collections from the public sales, this accumulates a wide range of antiques being imbued with historical values from a number of historical periods.",
        "Notwithstanding the aforementioned argument, I believe that free admission is more advantageous in terms of introducing the  history and culture  through museums exhibition and the fact that helps sightseers be easily accessing the museums. Regarding the former, free entering attracts more tourists to enjoy the museum demonstration, which is an effective way to introduce national identity to the world and create a favorable impression to global friends . Another major contribution is that people especially children can enter easily without hesitation about the fee, this gives them a chance to enlarge their knowledge about the home country history and build up the familial relationship when the whole family visit the museum together and share the experiences about a time gone by.",
        "In conclusion, in my view, it would be better if free entering were admitted by all the museums."
