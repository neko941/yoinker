        "A debatable topic is whether free social services should be enforced as part of high school curriculum, I would agree that implementing unpaid services as part of high school activities will encourage students in developing unknown skills and aid to reduce youthful deliquescy",
        "Why should unpaid charity work be engaged in student work?",
        "First of all, it helps in discovering new skills. Most times vlounteering services allows people from different schools and countries to participate as result, students are able to meet and exchange ideas amongst themselves motivating each other  to uncover new abilities that will be helpful  to them and also to their schools. A good example was when my cousin volunteered for an Art seminar in Spain, he was privileged to learn different genre's of  dance from other participants compared to routine hip-hop  dance which he only knew. This shows the  importance of volunteer services to students.",
        "Another reason why community services should be insisted in schools is because, it serve as a a good distraction in reducing nefarious activities  amongst students.  Since high schoolers will be engaging their time in doing free services that  will be more productive with their time hence, won't have the luxury for fivolous activities. Take for an instance in Sheba High school Maimi a school my sister attends, since the implementation of social services they have not recorded any case of drug abuse compared to when there were no free social activies in their school work. It is therefore ideal to  say that volunteering is a good idea that should be encouraged",
        "To conclude, it is evident that there is need  for free  community  activities to be enforced in high schools as it obviously improves the  skills and productivity of students."
