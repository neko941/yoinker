        "Globalisation has blured the lines of cultural diversity in these days. Many people believe that when an individual migrate into another culture they should accept local practices and customes. There will be both for and against arguments in this context.",
        "On the one hand, a person travel to another counrty or place inorder to exploit their culture and customs. Moreover, the experience we get from these travelling will broaden our perspective towards the society and people. However, an individual may face cultural shock as a part of this journey because our culture and their culture may contradict with each other. Furthermore, somethings that we do may hurt their feelings. So it is better to avoid these kinds of practice and we should accept their culture. Eventhough, we have our own rights to express our identity and culture. If we are ready to adapt their culture and local practice we can have a better life and peaceful atmosphere in that place or country. For instance, india is a country with a lot of moral values and cultural. Most of the people will not support homosexuality but in many countries it is legal to have this practice.",
        "On the other hand, globalization and migration has resulted in dilution of an individuals identity. In addition to that every person has the right to express his or her emotions and customs. It depends on each individual to individual. So we cannot compel someone to adapt something.",
        "On the aforementioned fact and data we can say that if one person is ready to adapt another culture and practice when that person teavel to a place will help in many ways. Moreover, as a migrant we have to respt their culture."
