        "The time to leave the family house is always a big dillema for young people and in some cases for old people as well, because sometimes is easy for youngs to leave their parents house as soon they become adults and might be hard for that people that were always been very look after their parents (spoilted).",
        "In both cases we can find strong reasons for stay and leave. Firstly we can talk about those that left their parents house, for them this might be a dream, live their own life, such as no need to say what time they will be back home, where they were, who were with them, what they were doing and at the same time being responsible for all duties that the adult life might ask you.",
        "For those that want to leave their parents house during the adult life (eg. middle 20's and 30's or even 40's in some cases), they might have the opportunity to save more money to buy their own house, car or whatever is the person's objective.",
        "In my point of view this dillema should not be a dillema, but this is one decision that only the young must decide. Sometimes our parents might need us for their activities while they are getting old and we need to be there to support them. However at the same point some families raise their kids to the world and to build their lifes how and where they want, but always be close for whatever they need. Because after all, family always will be your base and secure port."
