        "It is argued by some that a good way of connecting individuals from different backgrounds and ages is through the Art called \"Music\".  I am of the opinion this is good means through which  different way of lives can be learnt and also relationship between the young and old can be developed.",
        "Why is music a good way of bonding?!",
        "Firstly, through this activity, different cultures can be shared.  Because it is known that there different ways people live in the diaspora which needs to be shared with others who not familiar with this cultures. Therefore, people can pass on how they live and what is practised in their different countries through the sounds of music . For a good example in my country, the 21st of March is set aside for African Music Festival (AMF) which is a time when different artist from all over Africa  come to sing on one stage, it attracts both the young and old where they are able to meet, interact and learn about diverse beliefs of other countries through music.",
        "Moreso, Musicals creates a platform for the elderly and younger ones to bond. These days, alot of comtemporary songs are mostly enjoyed by all ages and hence fosters the relationship between the old and young generations since they can all relate to the this genre of Music.  For an instance, in most  Parties celebrated in my country  Nigeria, this traditional classics are mostly played to allow children, youth and older ones to participate in order to involve everyone in the celebration.  This illustration shows that these sounds plays an important role in connecting people together as to oppose bias beliefs that musical lyrics leads to societial decadence.",
        "To conclude, it is clearly agreed that a perfect way to initmate different societial believes and to develop bonds amongst families and friends is through the art of music."
