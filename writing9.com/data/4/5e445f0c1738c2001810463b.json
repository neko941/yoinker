        "I am student In high rank university, It is have a lot of features and it cares about everything. From my point of view, I think that sports and social  activities are not Important  as classes and libraries for reasons I show here.",
        "First of all, I am a student for five years, many students mainly came to the university for studying. So, they do not have enough  time for social activity and we are lives in Arab country, sport have not future carrier. For that, anything at universities other than classes is not important. Also, libraries are the place where the students can achieve a high score In their exams through hard studying, It Is the major aspect of students sucsses.",
        "Furthermore, the gym or the court where the students could do their favorite activities located  far away from  the main colleges and classes. If u want to join any club at university and you late, In this  case the professor will register you absent. In addition the couch will not give you any written excuses for being late. Therefore, for all these reasons that i mentioned earlier student will not have any desire  to join any club or do anything else. For all previous reason the universities shouldn't spend money on anything other than classes and libraries.",
        "Finally, In a high rank universities students mainly will be busy preparing for the coming exams. Also, there is a lot of supression from  both directins  universities and parents.So, for that universities can not be fouces on sport or social activities."
