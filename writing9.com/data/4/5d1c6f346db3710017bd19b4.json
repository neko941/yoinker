        "Our grandparents used to get energy for many uses by burning fuels. But with the development and technology scientists found more developed ways to get energy. Some of these ways is using the energy of blowing winds or even ocean waves, but the most common type of energy is solar energy. As we know everything has advantages and disadvantages. In this essay I will mention the positives and negatives of solar energy.",
        "Starting with the good side of solar energy. Getting energy to warm our homes from the sunlight is a way to improve and take care of our environment. When we use fuel to heat our homes or even for households we are destroying the environment by increasing air pollution and even using resources that can not be recycled, as well as, killing animals to build industries for burning fuels and ending up with the distortion of oceans and seas which is the home for fishes and sea animals.",
        "Even though heating our places with solar energy is useful for our environment, but it is not good on the other side. Some countries have more night hours than day hours in which they do not get enough time to warm their homes using solar energy. As well as, using solar energy is not cheap it needs equipments and solar systems which cost a leg and an arm , not anyone can afford the prices especially that life expenses are increasing and getting more higher than anytime before.",
        "Lastly, solar energy is a great invention to get heat from the environment without destroying the world. For sure in the future there will be more and more developed ways to get the energy we need for households, but for now solar energy is the best way beside getting it from winds and waves."
