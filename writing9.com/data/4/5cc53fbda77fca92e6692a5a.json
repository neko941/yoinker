        "There is no doubt that people prefer fashionable cloths, but what influences them in doing so? While some people contend that wearing fashionable cloths is fine, others think that it is trivial. This is both a good and a bad thing under certain situations. In this essay, I will discuss both sides and show the arguments.",
        "To begin, wearing clothes that are up to date could make individuals feel vivacious. This is because, wearing clothes that are modish could attract some attentions, which people may find joyful. To elaborate, a person in popular cloth might feel spirit-lifted in being noticed. Similarly, vaguish dresses might help singles to get in a relationship, for it can make them look attractive. Furthermore, no one would ever want not to be noticed as this could be really depressing.",
        "However, modern outfits may not always be comfortable because it could be above the comfort zone to achieve its looks. To clarify, wearing certain footware like high-heel could be attractive, yet it could be highly painful. Moreover, some modern dresses might not be favourable in certain environment. For instance, putting on short clothing during winter might not be comforting.",
        "In conclusion, fashionable clothing might be both good or a bad thing, and it depends on situations whether someone should wear them or not."
