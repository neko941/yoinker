        "It is irrefutable that fossil fuels are the main source of energy in many parts of the world,",

        "support my views with my arguments.",
        "The main advantage of using alternate sources is that the conventional sources like coal and",
        "oil are non-renewable. They take millions of years to make and we are finishing them at an",

        "and the sea is an everlasting source of power. So, more and more governments should come",
        "forward in promoting these sources.",
        "Another big advantage of these non-conventional sources is that they do not pollute the",
        "environment. We all know that global warming and damage to the protective ozone layer",
        "are caused by carbon-dioxide and other by-products of fossil fuels. If urgent steps are not",
        "taken towards the use of natural sources like sun and wind, then the time is not far when",
        "the whole earth will transform into a boiling pot.",
        "Although the use of these alternative sources has some hurdles such as the initial cost of",
        "setting up solar panels and wind farms is very high and these are also dependent on the",
        "geographical locations. However, once the initial cost has been met with, their maintenance",
        "is practically negligible.",
