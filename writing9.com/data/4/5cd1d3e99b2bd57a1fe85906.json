It is belive, that in compersion to others subject history render the knowladge aboutv role played by anscestors ;futhermore, plays a vital role in ones life, as one can learn alot from the past ecperiences. History, is a most significant schoool subject, brainwash student about the past devasting life incidents. History subject educated about these crucial situations, so they will aware of the consequmces amd hopefully avoid any situations in the future. however, others skills and medium of communications can be used for the same, rather than history as a school subject.",
        "On other hand, few people argue that, our future can be made superior only with the help of Science and Techonology. Hence, these subject should consider as the majoe important subject in school because itb helps to fused student with modern Techonology and revoluation, As, a major subject it will generate skillfull and expert students at  the field of Science and Techonology in  future. For Instence, some thimg that seemed impossible in few decades ago is  now available  at our fingure,. Communication is one of the best example of advancements in Techonology. In earlier days, on required numerous days to convey a message to someone, where as people are now just a phone call away.",
        "In contrast, although people may vary in their opinions, i concur that past is gone and we cannot improvise it by any cgande. So. we must focused to devloped new Invention in Science and Techonology. So that Science and Techonology ought to be most important school subject rather than history."
