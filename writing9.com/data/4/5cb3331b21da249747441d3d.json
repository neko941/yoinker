        "It is a graving issue that, nowadays, people do not know the family living next door properly as they used to do earlier. This essay will put forward two factors which has accelerated this problem and proposed measures which might address them.",
        "The main culprit of this phenomenon is that people are overwhelmed with their office work load and responsibilities. This is because the present generation is in rat-race of building their career. As a result, they are spending more time in office than home. Hence, they are not left with enough time to explore their neighbourhood. To tackle this issue, campaign should be run by non profits which explain the importance of work-life balance and advantages of strong neighbourhood to major corporates aswell employees. Moreover, local communities can also work as catalyst  by arrenging small gathering, which invite office-goers to spend time with nearby residents.",
        "Moving to the other factor, this pressing problem is increasing because of diversity among society where people form different culture and race live togather. It is tendency of human psych that they presumed  apprehension for unkown things and practice; therefor, they hesitate to welcome and mingle with neighbours having dissimilar culture. However, with proper counter measures this soft-spot can be made biggest strength of society. The government should run awarenss programmes which inculcate tolerance and educate about different cultures. Thus, public apprehension about other culture might be demolish. In longer run, this practice will build trust among communities.",
        "In conclusion, two of the main neighbourhood related concerns are intensely busy schedule and increase of diverse societies. However, these problems can be mitigated via emphasising work-life balance and educating people about other cultures and race."
