        "There were times, when people use to wander around the streets, hopping from one shop to another to meet their daily requirements, but with the growing technology and infrastructure, all the requirements are consolidated under one roof. There have been debates, that due to the making of malls there has been a drastic affect on the local stores, as people prefer shopping centres over local gorcerie stores. For me its an impactful development and not at all a negative one.",
        "To embark on, individuals have to face a lot of problems when it comes to shopping from",
        "mini local stores. For example, they don't get all the household stuff from one shop, for which they have to keep looking for products from one store to another which is time taking and frustrating. On the other hand there are parking issues, as the streets are narrow and crowded.",
        "However, talking about the positive aspects, the only one which I have personally experienced is, in urgency, when you need daily household things such as salt to cook food or biscuits to serve the guests, the local stores come handy as you cannot rush to a mall because it is not located next door, but this doesn't provide enough evidence for negative development.",
        "On the contrary, Shopping centres and Malls provide everything under one roof, from shopping to other activities such as gaming zones for kids and multiplex to spend quality time with family members. for example, in todays busy and compact schedules it gets difficult to spend time with the family members. To compensate parents along with thier kids head to malls on weekends to get full, out of their weekends.",
        "Moreover, Malls also provide locals with variety of brands from around the world to stay ahead in fashion, along with the same they also have great discounts to attract the audience which the local shops fail to deliver. On the other hand, customers don't have to deal with the hustle-bustle of traffic. Ample parking space is provided. In the end the questions arises, is this a negative development? which in my view points, is not.",
        "So to conclude, from the above discussion it seems the positive side of the development outweighs the negative side, as it saves you time, money and a much needed family time."
