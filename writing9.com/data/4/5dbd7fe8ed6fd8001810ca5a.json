        "Nowadays, garbage become main problem in urban life which are deposited in waste recycling by time become a mountain of garbage and commonly faced by all city governments. Consequently, Governments have to think hardly and take a solution how to recycle the mountain of garbage. Actually, the recycling of garbage could be begun from homes and separated based on the categories organic or inorganic waste. People could process the organic waste from domestic activity like cooking, by their self with buried the organic waste in their backyard or in some bag and fermented become fertilizers which it could be used for farming. Whereas the inorganic, like bottle plastic, food or drink can, paper, it's could not be processed by their self.",
        "Accordingly, the garbage's problem have to faced together between city government and urban people to take a similar action synergistically. Steps that have to do firstly is giving of the important information about the effect of waste in the life and how the role of urban people save our world by waste recycling. Therefore, there is needed urban people participation to socialize this campaign to other in their society, so awareness urban people to waste recycling would be built.",
        "The above steps should be strengthened by government law to regulate participation people in recycling waste campaign. The government should be issued some law regulation to take force people do recycling waste. Punishment would be given to the people, if they overlooked the recycling waste and still trash their garbage to the litter bag without recycling it.",
        "In conclusion, law is needed to strengthen the recycling waste campaign."
