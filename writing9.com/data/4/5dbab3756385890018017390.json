        "On this tablet we see information about what vehicle most kids used in age between 5-12 in time period 1990 and 2010.",
        "Mostly we could see that in 1990 most popular way was walking with bit more then 12 million kids used it to walk in their trips,then bus was nowhere near popular with only 6.5 million users. Cycling and walking and bus was much more popular compare to 2010 with near 6 million user each.",
        "In 2010 children mostly start to go in school with a car passenger, enormous number of 11 million young pupils. Much more then it was in 1990 with just a little bit more than 4 millions passengers used cars. Walking become much less popular with 6 million trips per year only. Other way to travel towards school such as Bus and walking and then use bus become less recognisable way to transport kids in school,with only 4.5 and 2.5 million kids ever used it yearly.  Cycling almost died in 2010 with hardly any kids travel in school that way. Only 2 million kids used this transport as a way to go in school.",
        "In conclusion we can see rapid growth in Car usage in 2010 and horrible decline in walking. As others way of transport also greatly suffered from popularisation of cars. Only bus stayed mostly on the same way ,but too was buckled up with car passengers with a near 2 millions children less comparable toward 1990.
