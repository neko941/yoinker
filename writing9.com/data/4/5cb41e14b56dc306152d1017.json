        "Education is the utmost right of every individual and no rule should cause one been refrained from the same. However, these days many universities are planning or has started the intake of equal number of male and female students in every stream. Such step has been equally appreciated and criticized by the people on the larger platform. Since I agree to this thought to a limited extent, In this essay, I am going to discuss the both sides of the statement and its impacts.",
        "To start with, In many nations like Pakistan where womens are still limited to household work and are not allowed to go out of home. And men usually acts as the protagonist and performs all the decision making. Such step will help in upliftment of women condition in the country, which in turn will help the society as well.",
        "In addition, there are many subjects which are being stereotyped based on gender. For example, cooking is still considered as females work and driving is men's. With such rule wrt gender equality in opting subject in universities, it will allow people from different background to try and excel in such fields.",
        "On the contrary, such regulations may cause a discrimination where the deserving candidates are left out and less deserving ones gets the position. In populous countries like India, where universities offers limited seats with respect to number of applicants; it becomes unfair for those who are better in accolades but due to such norms they have been discarded for admission to those universities.",
        "All in all, educational establishments has already started or many are still considering giving weightage to gender equality in every subject. By introduction of such step, it will give an edge to the society by providing an equal chances to all genders during subject selection. Whereas, it may lead to inequality with meritorious students and undeserving ones may flourish. Hence, it is important that such step should be rationalised before implementation."
