        "Studies clearly state that a person's personality and development are judged with their inborn qualities than any other references that he/she had come across in their live's. According to me only the inborn qualities that we possess would exhibit our character and our personality to the outsiders.",
        "Some peoples personality and their development are purely relevant on their character. These characters are not built all of a sudden these are qualities that should come from our birth. Each and every person in this world will have different or similar character but these qualities cannot be learnt or get reffered from others these has to come by birth. Learning and implying others quality to our routine will never ever give good impression to others. People will see us as a xerox of another person. Possesing other character will never define who the person we are, only the inborn qualities will give us the thrust for our personality and developoment.",
        "Eventhough, we learn some qualities from our fellow beings and applying it in our routine it will not be nice, because it would replicate only others not us. Although seeking good qualities from others would even enhance our true character, if we start to possess other bad qualities with us then it would kill our orginality and sometimes there are even chances of people hating us and even sometime we may forget our own character when we start to admire other inborn qualities.",
        "To conclude, exhibiting one's inborn qulities to the world, he would be recogonised as true human. Acquiring and adapting other qualities would kill our orginality. I support only the inborn qualities will have strong influence on our personality and development."
