        "Air pollution is one of the most discussed issue in modern day. This type of pollution is more common in large cities. The one of the main reason for that is large amount of private cars. The way to reduce this pollution is public transportation which is cheap and can carry many people at once. Even so most people will not give up their own cars because it\u2019s faster and easier to travel and go to some destination. Also public transportation doesn\u2019t have good reputation among people.",
        "So how to encourage people to take public transportation over a private car? First way is to make public transportation more attractive for people by making it faster to travel inside or outside of the city. In one program I saw that to make buses travel faster in city they planned to build a different road for buses only which help them avoid traffic congestion. This way people would choose bus in rush hour. Second way is promoting popularity of public transportation. This could be done by showing people a famous person taking a public transport. The last way is putting taxes on private car driver. This way might be effective but personally I would suggest use it only in extreme situation but in others I don\u2019t think this is a good way. Instead of taking money from them we can increase benefits of taking public transportation as I mentioned before.",
        "In conclusion if we make public transportation more comfortable and convenient it should work to attract more commuters. Passengers are like customers and public transportation should satisfy customers needs."
