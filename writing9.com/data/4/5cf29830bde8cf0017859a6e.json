        "Education has always been one of the major concerns in most countries. The government will always allocate a significant budget for education but are dedicated to public schools. This is especially true from our country, the Philippines.",
        "In the Philippines, there are a number of private schools offering higher standard education than public schools because they have means to acquire advanced technology to help improve their educational programs. The tuition fees from private schools are usually expensive whereas, public schools are for free because it is funded and supported by the government. Hence, I believe private schools does not to need receive government funding.",
        "Although, if the private schools consider to lower their tuition fees perhaps, there will be an increase in the number of students who will be available to enrol and attain better quality education. This is true from our country, the quality of education differs from private and public schools. In private school, the maximum students per class 30 whereas, in public schools one class can have 70 students with almost the same classroom size. Furthermore, private schools are equipped with computers, whiteboard, projects and the classrooms are air conditioned. The students from private schools are from rich and middles class families who are available to spend money for their education. While public schools only have the basic black board and wall fans in their classroom.",
        "In brief, private school already has the fund to sustain their facilities and equipment and does not need any funding from the government. Instead, the government should increase the fund in public schools to meet the quality education that private school can offer. In this case, the graduates from public schools will be as competitive as those from private schools."
