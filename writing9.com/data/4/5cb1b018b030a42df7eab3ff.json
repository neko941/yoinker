        "Some people believe companies should only promote those employees who has been working for a company for a long time. I am totally agreeing with those as it give workers working in a company more sense of appreciation.",
        "Firstly, promoting ones who already work in a certain firm give other employees a sense of appreciation. The reason behind this is if companies promote their employees within its structure than it will encourage other workers to work hard and get promoted. It will create a sense of competition all among staff to work hard and get the desire position. In contrast, if any business hire someone from outside company or one who just join and promoted it to a certain position it will have negative impact on employee working for a firm for a long time.",
        "Secondly, an old employee knows much better about a corporation than newly joined staff. If a person working for past 10 years, he knows many secrets of a business and can fulfill requirement much better than freshly joined employee. Every corporation have different set of hierarchy system and old employee exactly knows how certain work can be done within the firm. Long term employee may be more loyal as compared to novice employee as he is working long enough for the firm.",
        "To conclude, long term staff should be given preference when its time for promotion as it give other old and loyal employee sense of appreciation and also they are more knowledgeable than newly ones."
