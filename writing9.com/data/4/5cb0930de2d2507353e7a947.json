        "We are quite aware of the rising issues with the environment nowadays as there is no country in the world which is not facing problems such as pollution or global warming.I partially agree with solving the issue at an international level and the essay will lay out the points for both.",
        "As environmental problems are becoming a global concern,it is a mandate that these difficulties must be dealt at an international level.The laws and rules for all the countries regarding the contribution towards the worsening weather conditions must be made and it must be checked that which nation is creating more pollution or waste and accordingly the they must be penalised.It must be made compulsory for every counry to organise sessions and events to make the common people aware of the havocs these problems can create.",
        "It is vital that the these issues must be dealt at an international level however we cannot neglect the fact that every country must also deal with the issue at its own level also.As every country has its own geographical conditions,climate and with different type of industries,each country tend to produce different types of waste so they must also make rules to deal with the inhouse issues on their own.It will be a vital step towards acheiving a healthy environment for the world.",
        "With the drastic climatic changes that our worls is facing it is important that international laws are made to protect the world,and along with that every country must consider it as a major cause of concern and work towards the protection of environment so that our next generations can get a healthy world to live in."
