However, some people think  old buildings should be knocked down to make way for new ones because people need houses and offices. \nHow important is it to maintain old building? \nShould history stand in the way of progress?",

        "A lot of dated monuments are taken care by law enforcement authorities to safeguard a country's heritage. Few individuals believe that aged structures shall be demolished to build modern ones to accomodate working and living spaces. It is very cruicial to take care of historic builings as they are a reminder of a nation's culture and history never stands in the way of modernization if people keep a balance.",
        "Firstly, It is important to safeguard and maintain a nation's historic buildings because they represent the culture of the country. The nations who do not preserve their historic structures, loose their sense of identity and pride. For exmaple, in Italy, the government still take it very seriously to safeguard the dated buildings and it is a punishable crime by law if someone is found damaging any part of such areas.",
        "Secondly, old culture never stands in the way of progress. It is upto the residents of the area to keep a healthy balance of new and old. Nations take pride in their aged monuments and turn them into meuseums. For instence, a 300 years old palace of the king in Japan in Japan is still preserved and attracts millions of visitors yearly. People of Japan are proude of their history and culture and such historic buildings are a source of income for the local government as well as poeple.",
        "In conclusion, I would emphasize on preserving culture of any nation in the world, such places are our cultural heritage and remind us of our rich and dynamic past. Progress is never hindered by entique buildings but rusted minds."
