        "It has become ubiquitous to find stress-related illnesses affecting considerable section of the population. This essay will discuss the two main causes namely long working hours and commuting greater distances to office, as underlying reasons among the many for the illnesses. This essay will also suggest solutions to overcome the causes like maintaining a work life balance and residing closer to work place say within half an hour drive from home, in order to overcome stresses and attendant sicknesses",
        "Due to the increasing demands of modern life to live in comfort, people often stretch themselves at workplace. In order to own a house at affordable prices, they buy houses farther from place of work, resulting in long commute times. Due to easy access to credit from banks and to constantly feel pressurized to get validation from peers of certain social status, people pile up on consumerist goods and own house. All this results, in self imposed \u201coverwork\u201d at workplace and taking up additional responsibilities. This also adds to their misery of stress. As can be seen clearly, the pressures at work and driving long distances in city traffic can be unnerving, and largely result in physical and mental health issues.",
        "It may not be an exaggeration to suggest that a healthy work life balance overcomes issues related to work pressure. A shorter commute to work with hardly an hour\u2019s drive both ways can reduce stress considerably. The employers may take a house on rent for example near office to achieve this. All work and no play make Johnny dull boy goes the idiom and this is applicable to the average Joe who slogs at work. Researchers have found out from various studies that the stress relieving hormones oxytocin are released when spending time with family and friends. Thus it can be seen that people who invest their time wisely between work and family as well as have homes closer to offices have lesser stress related illnesses.",
        "To conclude, pressures of modern day consumerist society often push people to the brink of mental and physical sickness due to stresses. This essay discussed how stress is a function of long working hours and negotiating a demanding traffic on busy city roads. Additionally the essay also gave suggestions to overcome the underlying causes by having a better work life balance and shifting to residences closer to office."
