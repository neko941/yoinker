Consequently, not being able to find a job at first and having to pay the astronomical living prices could inflict huge financial prrssure. Another setback of of loving in a different country with different language could be the diffuclties of adopting to weather differences, which could lead to deppresion. For istance, how it would be possible for those who used to live in hot weather with unbroken sunshine",
        ",and now suddendly moved to a country with freezing weather and constand driving rain and snow? Simetimes, it could be impossible.",
        "On the other hand, living in country with different langauge broaden people's horizon.

To sum up, while living in a foreign country can create some discomforts, iit encreases individual's perspectives. Because of the numerous benefits living in another country could have, psycologist suggest that every person should give it try."
