Consequently, not being able to find a job at first and having to pay the astronomical living prices could inflict huge financial prrssure. Another setback of of loving in a different country with different language could be the diffuclties of adopting to weather differences, which could lead to deppresion. For istance, how it would be possible for those who used to live in hot weather with unbroken sunshine",
