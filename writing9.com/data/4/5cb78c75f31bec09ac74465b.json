        "It is broadely believed that leadership is innate skill although others think that every person can learn it who want passionately. .I am convinced that it depends on individuals themselves,both statements can be truth.",
        "On the one hand, there are several reasons why some people are persuaded that it is impossible to learn how to be a honest leader.First of all,it is hard to learn ledarship because  administrator means that someone who can easily  understand people , so patient , to make  everybody who work  with you happy .It does not reqiure only high qualification, but also encounteer real life issues .For example, some leaders who create a new company or organization can  faced a lot of difficulties but a real leader can solve them with a great patient.Society assume that these type of people born to be a leader.However, they do not know the fact that these people have faced with many dicreases.",
        "On the other hand, remain people with the right routing everybody can become leader.Reading popular leadership books written by famous CEOs  in the world help people to increase leadership skills. Right from primary school,children are taught to lead a group discussion or act as an arbitrator in a debate. This plays a role in forming leadership capacity in every individual.",
        "In conclusion,both views have their own merits.I am convinced that everybody can learn leadership if this person want it with enthuaism and never give up its decision."
