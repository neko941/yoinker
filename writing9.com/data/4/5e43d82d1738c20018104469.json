        "In the old days, many common skills like making the clothes and house repairs were managed by people themselves. However these common traits are fast becoming specialized or skilled jobs and no longer general public engage in them.",
        "There are two main reasons for this change in my opinion. Firstly making clothes and house repairs need some amount of time and specialized training. Traditionally these were passed on from generations to generations in the household. But the increasing socio economic pressure have made people to focus more on their specialized area of job or interest. Moreover, the move towards the urban areas and the increasing economic and job pressure have had limited the time left for taking up such activities.",
        "Secondly, with the increasing urbanization and technological developments complemented with recent trends in fashion, have given birth to a whole new set of industries. A common example is of the clothes, with new fashion trends emerging regularly and the mass production of clothes in the factories have made making clothes at home disappear. More importantly these factories also provide job opportunities and offer a variety of products people tend to buy it rather than making it at home.",
        "The same is also true for home repairs, with increased complex systems like dishwashers, laundry equipment, automatic doors, oven and stoves all need a specialized skill to perform the repair work. In addition you need to have a lot of tolls at hand, not to mention the details of the equipment.",
        "The situation is more or less same in my country, however in the viallges people still do these tasks themselves, but the trend is changing faster than ever before."
