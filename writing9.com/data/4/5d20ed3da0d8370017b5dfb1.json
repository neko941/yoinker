        "Nowadays, people have seen the need to travel out of there comfort zone and change environment, not only for the exposure, but for other gains, which would be discussed later on in this essay. This has led to increased rate of tourism and boost in the aviation industries all over the world, though with its pros and cons. For the purpose of this essay, i would be in support of international tourism.",
        "While there are many drawbacks to international tourism which cannot be overlooked, like peoples luggages getting missing on arrival, with all there valuables lost (of which my sibling was a victim of this in 2015), people are also exposed to life threatening diseases endermic in such countries. Also, 2018 statistics in the united states of America has shown that a lot of people who travelled to the states (especially Africans), never returned, as they decided to stay back and look for greener pasture. This has left a heavy burden upon the shoulders of there family members, as there is no one to fill the vacuum which they left. In some countries with increased terrorism, most tourists fall victim to these terrorist attacks. This doesn\u2019t take away the fact that there are many advantages of international tourisms like travelling for medical purposes, recreation, business and even educational purposes.",
        "In conlusion, while there are disadvantages of international tourism, the advantages actually outweigh them, and as such,  it should be encouraged for those who can actually afford them as the benefits can never be overemphasised."
