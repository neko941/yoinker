        "Many people believe that the personal data asked by applicants is irrelevant and useless  while others believe that it can prove beneficial to organisations. \u201cBut how can this data be useful?.This essay will discuss both the views in detail and give reasons why companies should collect the personal informatin of candidates.",
        "Many firms take personal data of candidates who wants to appear for the selection process. This record is quite beneficial for the company as they screen the resumes based on this information. Secondly, some minute information can help the company to identify the personality trait of employee which in turn will make screening process easy.",
        "For eg: A company wants to have a particular ratio of married to single employees in the company, so on the basis of this they will shortlist the candidates for further process. This will help them to create a diversity and further strengthing the work culture",
        "On the other side, if the data collected from the applicants is not utilized than it would be counted as a redundant exercise and would lead to wastage of time. Many small organisations who do not follow very stringent selection process do not use it, but they have standard application forms which require to fill all the details. For eg: Candidates coming for interview will unnecessalriy spend their time in filling this information. In this scenario, it is complete  burning of time for both parties.",
        "This essay discussed why collecting personal data is an important exercise for firms and for some it is futile. In my opinion, collecting personal data is quite  useful for companies as they are able to screen candidates more effectively and it creates strong work culture."
