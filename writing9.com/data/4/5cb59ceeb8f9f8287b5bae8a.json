        "The number of children gaining weight in the developed countries is increasing rapidly. Rich countries are concerned about the high ratio of overweight children. In my essay, I will discuss few causes and effects of the said issue.",
        "The first cause is directly linked with this modern era of technology and science. Children are amused by the video games in mobile phones, rather playing in park or academy clubs. Apart from the school timings, children spent their leisure time inside house playing computer games or surfing internet. They are distant from the physical activities, which makes it easier for children to gain mass. The second cause is the number of fast food restaurants in the commercial areas are huge. Families usually go out on weekends and ends up sitting in a fancy restaurant eating burgers, fried chicken, and other unhealthy foods. These fast foods are so rich in calories that, eating it on a weekly basis, without doing any physical exercise, can deteriorate children\u2019s physique.",
        "Children\u2019s getting overweight is a huge concern for any country. This problem needs urgent rectification, otherwise it can bring long term decline in the economy of wealthy countries. If parents did not control the routine of their children, then they might get sick with increased frequency, and lead them to sudden death in some cases. It is said by some doctors, that obesity is the root of all diseases. If we are not having a healthy weight, then viruses get easy access to attack the human body because of weak immune system. Children are virtually connected with others via internet, however they are not physically attached with others, thus weakening self-confidence and social interpersonal skills. Having said that, this can lead to poor performance in academics and in a longer run, it can have negative impact on country\u2019s growth.",
        "To summarize, overweight problem in children should not neglected by the parents and government. There should be awareness programs, run by government, for the people to realize the effects of this issue. Temporary and permanent countermeasures should be implemented to discourage the growth of overweightness in children."
