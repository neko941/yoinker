        "Today's law has many wings and sub-wings with full of rules, regulations, clauses vis-a-vis sub-clauses, out which one of them is restrictions about hard drugs like heroin and cocaine. Consumption of such drugs is too hazardous to human life so as such were banned for sale or use. In addition to these, other types like tobacco, alchohol also are to be completely refrained from export or import, sale or utilize them.",
        "Government has to ideally, take strict steps to abolish the usage and purchase of such poisonous items, which kills the span of a person very badly and repidly. Depletion of smoke and drink leads to fatal diseases like Cancer, Liver Problems, Heart Attacks, Brain Strokes and so on, besides, will not leave the person till he dies. Even when he is alive, it won't allow the individual lead happy days, rather would keep them suffering, keeping them at stake.",
        "Medical facilities are abundantly provided for such cure but it is aptly said and believed that \"Prevention Is Better Than Cure\", which has to be adhered thereto.",
        "There is no assurance of receovery even after multiple Chemo therapies, steroids, etc, are given, that, such life shall survive long. It makes the blood cells get infected in microscopic cells, with a infinity multiplying growth rate to the entire body or organ, once after such attack. There are many mind tuning programs available for coming out of these deadly habits, but again fashion in the modern trend tempts for wrong side only. Making the rules is not the only way but firm standardization and stern decisions are the key paths to enhance the such in a positive angle.",
        "Concisely, I feel very strongly that stabilizing along with actionables, awareness programs, is very much required for aboilishing such destructive activities, that show impact on oneself, family and society, declining the human values, beofre it deteriorates the World."
