        "Many hold the opinion that physcial activity is an imperative subject in educational institutions, whereas, others think that children should be given the right to decide whether or not they want to paritcipate in them.Both these views will be examined for the remainder of this essay, followed by a reasoned conclusion.",
        "On the one hand, the benefits of sports are uncountable. Firstly, they pave the way for school kids to move their bodies in a fun and motivating way. Which is important because, excercise is one of the building blocks to total body wellness and health. Therefore, curriculum's should compromise of sports classes. This way, they will complete their daily requirement of burning calories of 300 per day. Secondly, this set up facilitates a way for children to influence their families and siblings to lead healthier lives.",
        "On the other hand, it is argued by many that sports should be optional. Although there are tangible benefits, not all yougsters are interested in sports, therefore they do not enjoy them. Furthermore, many families take their kids to football, ballet and basketball lessons outside the school premises, for that reason they believe school should be academically orientated. For example,",
        "In conclusion, althought i believe in human rights and freedom of speech, i also believe that excercise is an imperative subject in schools and should be mandatatory for children to participate in. In the future, i hope institutions worldwide provide physical activity classes."
