        "Owing to the convenient transport and advanced communication technology, people\u2019s habitat is not fix and they are able to live in the place where they prefer. Although a large population in one area is likely to lead to the huge consumption of the local natural resource, people will also gain superior living quality what they can not achieve in other places.",
        "On one hand, a mount of residents living in the same city can result in a extremely quick speed of consuming resource. Human beings not only have to drink water and breath fresh air for surviving, but also need to extend the area of city which means to turn forests or farmlands into communities or factories for living or working. As an example, the population in the capital of China is 20 million, and there are rarely farmland surround. This is the main demerits of staying anywhere by individuals\u2019 preference because of the high rate of the consumption.",
        "On the other hand, the greatest benefit of living in the dreamful region usually stem from the brilliant life in that area. The lifestyles in different regions are always different and folks absolutely are more enjoyable to follow the lifestyle what are suitable for them. For instance, employees in India have to overwork since it is the only way to earn enough money to feed families, whereas most Canadians can get the reasonable income even if they just work 8 hours per weekday. Escaping from the circumstance what people hate and settling in the great one is intensely vital to improve general populations\u2019 life quality.",
        "I would therefor argue that although there are cons of choosing living place by individual\u2019s preference, such as the damage of the local resource, they are outweighed by the pros since  the city with huge population can be supplied resource by other places. Living and working in the favorite place is an effective way to choose a satisfied life style and to be easier to attain a superior life what people can not achieve in other places."
