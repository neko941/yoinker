        "Teacher is a person who shape up the entire life of the student through his or her knowledge and they are influencer for students. It is true that teacher have more impact on students than their parents. I totally agree with the statement that teacher play vital role in intellectual and social development. In this essay will discuss the both views and justify my view.",
        "To commence, children spend quality time with teacher. Although, they spend more time with parents at home but this is not as productive as the small amount of time spent with the teacher. We all know that parents are busy with their work most of the time and even if children are around, they hardly pay attention to them. However, all teacher is either teaching or guiding them in extracurricular activity. They keep focused on children's study and as a consequence of this they have more intellectual impact on them.",
        "Moreover, teachers are role model of students. They are not only influence their student intellectually but socially too. In addition, student follow teacher's behavior. They observe how they tackles difficult situations. On the other hand, at home parents could influence socially but it is seen that in nuclear family parents hardly find time for this. Children learn social skills from TV or other activities they do at home. Thus, teachers are more important than parents for social skills.",
        "However, parents are important as same as teacher because they are more aware of the world and they have better capability of guiding them. Also, they know very well to own child than teacher so they can influence them in proper way. So, children are also depending on parents.",
        "To conclude, it can be said that once schooling starts, teacher can be helped more to make student intelligent and social person but parents also do contribution in it. So, I agree with the statement that when children get admission in school, teacher have more impact on student."
