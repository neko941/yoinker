        "The common feature of the internet today is that people are more socially involved with each other. Both Mobile phones and internet serve the same purpose. I believe, that the advantages outweigh disadvantages.",
        "The foremost advantage of mobile phones and internet is that people remain socially connected to each other. No matter if your son or daughter is far away from you, you can always connect with them at any point of time. it is a difficult task these days to take time out of one's busy schedule and socialize. Mobile phones and internet serve the  purpose. No matter where you are, whatever you are doing, you can always get some time and socialize with your loved ones.",
        "There are different social media platfomrs these days who are serving the same purpose. Not only your relatives but you can socialize with people who have same interest as yours. There are few other professional social media platforms as well where you can look for jobs while sitting at home.",
        "On the other hand, there are some adverse effects of internet as well. Generation gap between parents and children has widen. Children mostly spend time with their mobilephones playing online games or surfing the internet while parents are alone and deprived of children care. Unlike old times when children used to spend more time with their parents.",
        "To conclude, mobile and internet has both pros and cons and are directly effecting our lives. I strongly believe that they play a positive role among our lives, as it is totally on us how to make use of it. I believe, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
