        "With the increase in demands of population, number of shopping malls are also increasing at fast pace. However, this has a negative impact on local shops and many of these are being replaced by the malls. From my persuasive, malls affect local markets and the ensuring essay will discuss and elucidate about this certain issue.",
        "To begin with, shopping complexes are considered to be curse for small shops as the mitigate their businesses. These days people prefer to do their shopping from supermarkets because they found it easy to accumulate desirable things under one roof.  Needless to say, growing malls is one of the most evident way for declining marketing of local shopkeepers. Moreover, this malls attract buyers by giving discount on items which directly influences the business of small shops. Markets at local level, are facing many difficulties as majority of masses are diverted towards them for purchasing things from groceries to clothes which means lets profit owners of small shops.",
        "In addition, people often buy unnecessary products and waste their savings by paying handsome price of them. They get blind on viewing diversity of brands for one particular product and ends with buying expensive one as they believe that they are better than those available shops. Furthermore, malls are also responsible for losing culture and the reason behind this is that there are certain items only accessible at local level and many times ignored by purchasers. Hence, malls are evolving the small shops.",
        "In conclusion, I recapitulate that major cause of decreasing local markets is enormous shopping malls which are not only affecting the shopkeepers but also has a major contribution in sweeping away the tradition."
