        "In certain countries youngsters pursue their university studies after a break. Either they opt for working or travelling before starting with their higher education . In this essay we shall discuss the pros and cons of the same.",
        "Going for work or travelling bring in a different perspective. It breaks the monotony of the cliche paths taken.  Young people chose to work as it helps them with the practical aspect of life. Working in a real environment helps in pushing and challenges the individual. Money earned through work can help in paying university fees. Further, several people take up travelling to explore the world and discover themselves.  Goals clearly are solidified in the process of doing this. Thoughts are clearer, ambitious are well defined.  An example from my own experience, i worked for a year at an audit firm after my graduation . With the money earned and the experience gained i was at a better pedestral than my peers for my higher university studies. In the United states of America , youngsters work part time and study simultaneously. In India , youngsters finish their education at once before pursuing anything else.",
        "However, young people definitely lose out on the continuity in education if extensive years of work or travel is taken up.  Studying , writing for exams becomes a task in case where breaks are longer.  Travelling leads to excessive spending ultimately leads to trouble in paying for university studies. Extensive working at a tender age leads to stress.",
        "Keeping the above discussion in mind, I would conclude by saying youngsters should consider all their options carefully before deciding on whether to take a break or to immediately take up their university studies."
