        "It is well-known fact, that the sports people enjoy much better salaries, than other professionals. This fact has evoked many debates weather it is fair or not. From my point of view, each profession is worthy, so the big gap between sportsmen's and other's earnings is not justified.",
        "On the one hand, there are many arguments, supporting the high incomes in sports. One of them is the prestige of a country, which can be built by the successful and winning sportsmen in the international arena. A good example of this can serve an Armenian chess player Levon Aronyan, who contributed to the increase of Armenia's fame in the world. Another argument, supporting the idea, that sportsmen should earn more is the statement that they are excellent models for the young children, since their professions in the core are encouragement of the healthy lifestyle.",
        "On the other hand, one cannot deny that all types of job are result of human and non-human needs. Hence, it would be very difficult to live in a world, where people are in need of doctors, teachers, chemists, cooks, to name but a few. So the complains of those who want to see balance in incomes between sportsmen and other profession in terms of payment is understandable. If a sportsman is a model, then who is a teacher? The teachers are responsible for the education of a society, but they earn very little, comparing to sports people.",
        "To sum up, despite the fact, that famous sport stars can support others and deserve well payment, other professions should not be underestimated, so there is a need to decrease the noticeable gap of salaries."
