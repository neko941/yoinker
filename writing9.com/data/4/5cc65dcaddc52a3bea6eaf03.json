        "In this modern globalized world, there is increase in number of people who are suffering from diseases. According to doctors, people are physically inactive. There are many reasons that has led to this situation. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons and possible solutions to get out of this unhealthy lifestyle.",
        "Our lifestyles have been affected by the remarkable advancement in the technology and this has impacted the daily life and health of humans.",
        "In offices, most of the work is done on the computers. Without any break, people sit in front of computers and same goes for people who watch televisions at home or children who play video games. Mostly have televisions installed in their bedrooms. This affects the health of adults. According to a medical survey issued by medical association of England, continuous exposure to computer screens causes depression, stress, anxiety, diabetes, heart as well as problem related to eyes.",
        "Moreover, people are becoming lazy to cook healthy food rather they rely on cheap takeaway food, that is mostly processed and is full of calories, fat, etc. No exercise and unhealthy food takes toll on the health of the individuals.",
        "It is the responsibility of individuals, parents, teachers and government as a whole to help people transition from unhealthy to healthy lifestyle. The individuals need to monitor their food habits so that they can include those foods that really helps them maintain good health and active lifestyle. Government can restrict unhealthy fast food stores especially near schools. As it has been seen that school children are more prone to buying fast foods such as fried foods and soft drinks. By introducing the concept of open gyms, government can motivate people to do physical exercises in natural setting rather than a closed space gym and are accessible to everyone.",
        "To conclude, we as individuals and government has responsibility for the health of its citizens."
