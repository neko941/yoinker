        "In recent decades, the amount of traffic congestion and consequent arduous journey period has been increasing rapidly, especially in Metropolitan cities and major centres. We must have to develop a detailed understanding of why this disgraceful situation has been occurring so that we can tackle it effectively.",
        "The major reasons of being delayed to reach destination are connected to overpopulation and lavish lifestyle, as well as lack of implementation of laws. Firstly, towns are no longer remaining a healthy living place mainly due to huge population and followed traffic jam. Clearly, this happens when a great deal of citizens are attracting to the city-amenities and thereby deciding to live here permanently, which automatically making the urban jam-packed slowed in every aspects. In addition, as the consumaristc lifestyle becoming dominant, individuals are far more oriented to personal vehicles such as cars for ease and comfort. Clearly the more the number of cars on streets, the more they get delayed as they all rushing towards the same destinations, for example, schools, offices, organisations etc. Finally, poor implementation of regulations are prevalent in most cities: driving unfit vehicles to illegal parking on here and there are common scenarios which are largely responsible for this excessive journey period.",
        "A range of effective strategies can be taken to resolve this problems. First and foremost, strict laws could be initiated for arresting migration flow. Those migrating illegally can be penalized. Authorities can also shift the major centres dispersely throughout the country so that citizens no longer feel the urge to stay in cities and make it overcrowded. Similarly, discouragements through the imposing taxs and extra charges on personal cars could be taken to resist the resulted delay. Lastly, if a rigorous law of the rule breakers ranging from lacking driving license to illegal parking could be spotted on, and if trained traffic polices, survellaince cameras and other state-of-the-art technologies could be initiated, the likelihood of congestions on roads would decline consequently. Undoubtedly, this could decrease the travelling time.",
        "Overall, a range of useful steps Minister could be taken that would by default make the journeys pleasant by shortening the travelling time. However, I am largely convinced that this horrific trend is likely to rise in upcoming futures as the powers-that-be seem reluctant to take rapid actions. From the every commuter's perspective, it is a detrimental development."
