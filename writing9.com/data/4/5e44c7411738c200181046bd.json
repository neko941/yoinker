However , children used to tired with educational activities and they transfer their attention to other activities for leisure time. It is completely acceptable and reasonable.",

There are possibilities they may lose energy, concentration and capacity. As a result the main purpose of fun activities is destroyed.",
        "If students do they what they please to do in leisure time, it can reduce burden. Being timepassed it is also possible to transfer their hobby into a successful career. Even though it may not be concerted into career it can have a vast effect in student\u2019s educational profile.",
