        "The pictures illustrate a number of important changes which took place in a town after",

        "From the maps, it is clear that the most noticeable change that occurred in the town was that of a huge lake. Additionally, the forest and farmlands had completely disappeared by 2010.",
        "In 1990, there was an ancient structure and a forest with rare \ufb02ora and fauna to the west of the river, and irrigated farmlands to the east. However, with the construction of a dam wall, those features disappeared beneath a large lake, which also became a fishing area in 2010.",
        "Looking at the maps in more detail, while the mountains still existed, the villages in the far east were relocated further south of the mountains, and a large hotel was built in their place. Meanwhile, a hydroelectric power dam was constructed with a wide range of electricity pylons appearing nearby."
