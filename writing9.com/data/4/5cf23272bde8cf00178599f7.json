        "In this modern technical era, socialising by social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and so on is a huge trend among the majority of the masses. However, in my opinion, it is a negative development of the modern world.",
        "To initiate, users of such media get entangled in the virtual world, and it makes an adverse impact on their personal social life. People can get in touch with the person who lives far away from them that they do not know the person who lives next to them due to less communication with them. Communicating online instead of face to face can also increase the feeling of adverse insecurity because, by virtual type of communication, one can not get the personal sense very profoundly. Therefore it becomes a significant factor in increasing trust issue.",
        "More consideringly, making a friend by social media is in trend as well. There are a plethora of fake accounts which have occupied a prominent place on all the social media websites. Consequently, cybercrime such as blackmailing, cheating and scamming have increased significantly.",
        "In conclusion,  socialising online has several consequences, such as getting cheated, effects on personal and social life scarcity of interest in real life relationship, therefore it leads to a negative development."
