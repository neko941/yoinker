        "It has becoming popular to control the children by some short of punishment. Physical penalty is the best way to control children behaviour. This essay will argue why smacking children is entirely necessary to teach them manners despite the parent\u2019s emotion.",
        "Parents have always been trying to establish a best practice to curbing their children. They are justifiable worried about If their children obay the rules in school or somewhere else that could be lead them on wrong path of future. Indeed, there have been some instances of children those mother and father does not show them right way or without any kind of punishing, which could potentially take them begin to be irresponsible person. These few examples bolstered existing fears in parents that penalizing has becoming completely necessity to bring children on correct form of discipline.",
        "Despite some parents getting more emotional while giving penalty to their children, instead of this, those parents who are begin to be draconian against their children mistakes that could be beneficial to make them smarter and intelligent. Such as by doing regular school assignments on timely eventually teach them time management manners. Therefore, acceptable hitting to children merely option to understand the importance of the self-behaviour.",
        "In conclusion, this essay argued that people who are less develop the method of punishment for their children, ultimately unable to teach them disciplinary. in my opinion, parents should apply a suitable punishment to their children to grow well."
