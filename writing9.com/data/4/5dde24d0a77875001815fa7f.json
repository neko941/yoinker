        "The world has shrunken to a small place since the introduction of social media.Global market have been taken hostage by instagram,twitter,facebook and social media applications.This essay will particularize the facts that how buyers are persuaded and compelled by the advertisements of the products on social media.The latter part of essay will spell out the solid grounds that i believe in are somehow affecting the users buying.",
        "As a matter of fact,i totally agree with the marketing by celebrities and glamour projected on social media have masked the intellect of buyers.Social media is a platform for information of all of its kinds for the user.In addition to this tricky act,it is further skyrocketed by the availability of online sales centres.While sitting on the couch in your drawing room,all you need is a card,interent access and a smartphone you can buy anything from all the corners around the world.",
        "People on social media sets a trend by sharing,tweeting.while putting a status online infact draws attention of many as well as lot fire in the hearts of watchers as well.Statistics have shown that majority of social media users are youngester and the shopping breeze comes from looking on the attractive necklace someone is wearing.",
        "Illustrating my point by that when a potential buyer searches something online just to kill time.Later on the relevant adverts will pop on its own.Given the facts,young social media users who are prompted and manipulated by current shiny trends and happenings by movie stars will always catch their eye.",
        "In the conclusion,adverts,the backbone of marketing are form of information but with makeup and internet era ,this informaion catches everyone despite their age group.This spreading and flaring the current faster than the  wild fire.Therefore,i would say in favour and it makes more sense ,in this modern age of technoogy, globalization and social media trends ,heart melting eye catching marketing determine what users buy."
