        "Technology has brought significant changes in the society. Certain people believe that technical knowledge is only the reason of creating distance between poor and rich people. However, others do not agree with this statement. I would put forth my points about these two different opinions.                                                                        To embark with,  high technology is positive development that brings people together. For instance, computers and different kinds of websites  had turned this world in to a small global village. Moreover, it  advances industrial revolution that really increase the evonomy of nation. For example machinery like airplanes, telephones, change the world and make it easy to travel and talk to whole of the world. Due to this, many people are able to expand their business to different countries and became successful in their life.                                                                   On the other hand, some people argue that because of tecnical advancement poor peole becoming poorer and rich are becoming more richer in society. Somehow it is true because poor peole does not have money to use new machines and they are treated like slaves in industries. To operate  advanced machinery , number of skills are required and poor people do not have those abilities as of lack of education. Also, they are not getting enough pay as they are not intelligent. Business man have negative thinking about poor people and they thought that they are less valuable in company and they can throw them out from company if they will talk against the owner.                                                  in a nutshell,  believe that every rose has thorns. According to me technology has great benefits for society. Expertes said that if you born in poor family that is your luck but if you die in poor family that is your choice. So people can be rich by using their skills in modern technology."
