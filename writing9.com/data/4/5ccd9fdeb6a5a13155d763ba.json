        "Before the invention of motor vehicles, there was only one mode to commute which we call it as bicycle. It was invented back in 19th century by a german civilian named Baron Carl. It took not long enough to invent motor vehicles or say cars. Since then people are more facinated about motor vehicle not just because it is faster but also because it is more comfortable and needs less struggle to operate. As the time passed, the advancement took place one after the other and bicycle was taken over by cars. People now-a-days try to use it more and more to almost everything for example going to trips or to get groceries. There is no limit for it.",
        "Today, we are so comfortable about it that everyone owns, which is now increasing the traffic and pollution. Government organization of some countries are spending money extravagantly on promoting the usage of  bicycle over motorized one because they are facing multiple challanges like pollution, traffic, fuel import and etc. Countries such as Germany, Finland and china are among top 10 countries who has taken these initiative and have shown remarkable results. It is the best solution for traffic congestion and pollution. Traffic congestion in these countries are tremendously low because of such steps.",
        "This mode has also proven that not just they are economic but also healthy for environment and human beings. It produce zero pollution and keeps one healthy as it boost the metabolism decreases stress level and many more to go but the major question is that, is it really that crucial to use it now?",
        "In my opinion, yes it is important to start using bicycle as much as possible because we as human are utilizing natural resources so recklessly that the day is not far enough when we will be out of those resources and due to pollution the nature will also stop regenerating and which will left nothing but a waste land for our next generation."
