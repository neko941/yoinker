        "Although many countries have a regulated salary structure which is expected to create a balance in the expenditures of the government but it has been discovered that a small number of people receive extremely high salaries .This doesn\u2019t create a balance if they are working for the government of a state or country.",
        "A lot of these individuals are found to be political appointees in my country and they are not working like the other citizens thus making them highly rated .They are given preferential treatment while the vast population are on a salary scale and usually write examinations to move to the next grade in order for their salaries to be raised.",
        "A lot of citizens are not supporting the government  by pushing back and holding rallies to enlighten the people and create awareness on the injustice being meted out to them .others believe that a regulated salary structure will create equality among the citizens and would make things easier for the work force in terms of provision of great opportunities for their family members.",
        "My opinion on this issue is that the salary structure should be regulated , applied to every citizen of the country ,and create a stress free ,conducive working environment.A good example is the way Government establishments in my country is believed to be a place where lazy people go to work and there is no passion  in carrying out their duties, however, the citizens believe that the government is being partial.",
        "A typical example is the politically appointed public office holders who are paid in millions to just sit,hold meetings and pass bills which is the national assembly members.I belive those office holders do not possess the qualification top possess such office.If the salary is regulated to the level of public office holders, a lot of qualified people will be willing to work for government."
