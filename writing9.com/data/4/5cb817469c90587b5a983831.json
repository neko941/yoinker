Employees and their families will get some advantages, moreover, life would be becoming more stressful. Both the views needed to be discussed in this essay.",
        "In today\u2019s hectic life, when individuals do not have enough time for their roots; accessing work from home will give more freedom and leisure time to them. As a result, they will understand each other from depth as well as respect feeling of others. Furthermore, it is also true that plethora workers want the opportunity to learn and achieve at work, if the life of person is stress free, can concentrate more and produce more productive business.",
        "However, numerous people in society find achieving a balance between their work and life difficult. They work long hours, for example, great deal of time is getting waste in travelling to and from work; sometimes extra working time in office, for which they are also not getting paid. Due to this, breadwinner, who are working for their families; to give them appropriate lifestyle, are not able to spend adequate time with them, which leads to stress and irritability.",
