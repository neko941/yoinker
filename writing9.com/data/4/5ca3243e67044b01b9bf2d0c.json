        "and social life. Firstly, telephones and the Internet allow business people",
        "in different countries to interact without ever meeting each",

        "relationships between students and teachers. For example, a student can",
        "now take video lessons with a teacher in a different city or",
        "country. Finally, many people use social networks, like Facebook, to",
        "make new friends and find people who share common interests, and they",

        "On the one hand, these developments can be extremely positive.",
        "Cooperation between people in different countries was much more",

        "face-to-face meetings, and many of us benefit from these interactions,",
        "either in work or social contexts. On the other hand, the availability of new",
        "communication technologies can also have the result of isolating people",
        "and discouraging real interaction. For example, many young people",
        "choose to make friends online rather than mixing with their peers in the",
        "real world, and these \u2018virtual\u2019 relationships are a poor substitute for real",
