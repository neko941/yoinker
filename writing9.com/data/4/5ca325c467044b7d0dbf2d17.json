        "academic theories of algorithm, which are hastily acquired by well- qualified students.",

        "manpower for society to do well in any fields. This is because they take advantage of",
        "productive phase of their life so as to enhance the existing knowledge for solving any",
        "troubles in any fields.",
        "However, universities should accept all applicants of all ages and those with less remarkable",

        "rights perspective, individuals can apply to any academic course in university as long as they",

        "accepting all ages is crucial for most. Depending on how to contribute for community,",
