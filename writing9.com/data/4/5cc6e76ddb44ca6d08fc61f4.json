        "Modern days have become more accustomed to improper diet and irregular food habits with varied reasons like busy schedules at work, rush to office or household works, timings with family, children, friends and many more. This has made drastic change in human beings' life with many negative impacts resulting in numerous health problems. An individual is facing too many medical issues right from infants till the age of nineties.",
        "As such, medical facilities ah as re to be provided adequately to each lame person at the pros and cons of the place. Nationwide support is always important while it pertains to health as the human life is ensured upon the functionality of the body. Organs, blood, Nerves, Muscles, bones and even the hair and skin matters for small note of illhealth. Proper economic growth with accurate planning in the country's infrastructural facilities with productive idealogies shall obviously, increase the standards of a Nation. So that, provision of medical infrastructural facilities like medicines, drugs, injections, salines, and many more can be abundantly supplied free of cost to every individual whenever essential and whomever applicable for. Government should be spectacular in modernising the way of such provisions adding value to human life.",
        "Many times, it is noticed that poor people has no money in hand due to which they are unable to get treated intimes of emergency which leads to death. Perhaps, they are not in a position to demand for the necessities and can only lift up their hands. Moreover, rural areas are lacking adequate medical facilities and awareness of medication to a larger extent. Despite they rely on the ancient day methods of curing a disease with herbs, leaves and other sort of wild procedures which may or may not work out in resolving the problem. Besides, such olden paths shall create new problems with severe side effects which later, cannot be solved or understood.",
        "Keeping in view all the above, I strongly feel free medical facilities are to be supplied to every one in all the countries to the maximum possible extent with ultimate equipments which are affordable, if not expensive. Conclusively, such service can not only increase the Nation's economy but also ends up in happiness of lives."
