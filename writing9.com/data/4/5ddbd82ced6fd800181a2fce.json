        "Some people consider that students should learn how to behave rightly in the school.This is because teachers have the required skills in instilling the spirit of cooperation in children. learning to understand and share values system cannot be achieved alone at home. At present, a child, in Nigeria, begins school at about three years, thus, entering into a wider community, which comprises of teachers and peers from plethora of backgrounds.This is where all that were learnt or seen  by the parents , are brought to limelight.It is then the duty of the teachers to filters all kinds of behaviours ,while educating them on the proper way of behaviour Consequently, children are made to understand their peers and foster the spirit of cooperation among them.",
        "On the other side of the argument,parents are thought to instill manners on their wards. Being the first agent of change, it is  the sole  responsibility of the parents to ensure that values, morals and integrity are passed down to their wards. Children learn by mimicking. Hence,  guardians should lead by examples.For instance, I learnt how to respect my elders by simply watching my parents.  caregivers spend one-one  interaction with theirs young ones ,and should be responsible for bringing up the children in the acceptable way, deemed fit by the society in which they belong.",
        "In conclusion, even though learning centres has a shared role to play, in order to foster cooperation in youngsters, I believe the onus is on parents to teach their wards to become an exception citizen of the nation."
