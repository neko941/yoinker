        "Work and salaries are from the most debatable issues that people used to talk about in our everyday life. Despite the great stress faced by some actors or musicians or sport stars in their work, there are some people who see that these groups of people are taking a huge amount of money.",
        "I totally agree with this and I see that the government have to put the spot on some more important professions like teachers and physicians.",
        "Firstly, there is a huge difference in wages between ordinary people and community stars. The famous people in the society used to be paid a fortune by the production companies or by famous sportive clubs. Everyday, we hear on the news that a certain actor has signed a contract with a production company by a million dollars.",
        "Furthermore,this money must to be paid to people who are playing a very important role in the society rather than being famous. Teachers who make a great effort to deal with youngsters and to teach them how to be successful and also, physicians who are always studying how to overcome certain dangerous types of diseases.",
        "I do not underestimate the role of actors in a society, however, I see that they must be paid less than this and these huge amount of money can be spent on buying advanced equipments for hospitals or improving the quality and the methods of teaching in schools especially, in developing countries."
