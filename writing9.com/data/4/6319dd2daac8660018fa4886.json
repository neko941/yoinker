        "The bar charts compare how much money people in E had to averagely spend on their accommodation as well as that in their capital city and other regions in 2 years, 1995 and 2013.",
        "In general, the average house price in England, including in London, increased over the given period. Moreover, the average figure for England, in general, was always lower than that of London, with the gap being enlarged with time. In the year 2013, Midlands and Northeast were the two regions that had the most affordable house price, while houses in South East, Southwest and Northwest cost more considerably.",
        "In 1995, it cost 130k pounds on average to afford a house in England, while that amount in London was 70k higher. 8 years later, the house price in England increased to 200k. Yet, it took people double to possess a house in London, which was over 400k to be specific.",
        "In 2013, accommodation in Southeast, Southwest and Northwest cost from 200k to over 300k. However, houses in the remaining two regions, Midlands and Northeast only priced a third of that in Southeast, which was just around 100k."
