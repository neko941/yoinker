Day by day the health condition of the people is at high risk. The food habits and the time management of the people playing are playing crucial for this kind of situations.",
        "Even though, if we are maintaining good diet and maintaining good health conditions also leading to many problems. After the technology has increased everything has become artificial in our daily life.

        "I believe that, it is not only about the food habits, but also environment and global warning involved in it. Now a days global warning is utter most important thing which humans are facing. Nevertheless the pollution and climatic changes are certainly increasing, which are creating by humans itself. In coming days it will get tougher for mankind to sustain on earth. According to the recent studies, It is declared that humans gonna face lot of difficulties in survivng. People are habituated to robotic life which is very hazardous, it will not cause for instance, but in a longer run it might affect. Heredity is a common thing which is seen which will moreover affect the future generation."
