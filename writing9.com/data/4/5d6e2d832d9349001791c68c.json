        "Many suggest that tutoring secondary school students on money management, they believe it is an uptmost skill in life . I personally disagree with this view.",
        "It is thought by some people believe that juveniles should be taught how to spend money wisely. This is because they are potential parents and leaders tomorrow,if they know the value for money right from their early adulthood, they would certainly be a better manager of funds as adults. Therefore, they would have the ability to make good financial decisions when they are independent. Additionally, when wards have this skills, parent would  comfortably entrust them with valueables such as cars, jewelry, houses or even cash. Hence, families maintains close relationship and trust in each other.",
        "Nevertheless, In my view, teenagers need not to be trained on money management as they are financially dependent on their guardians and parents. In other words, the information is not useful to them at this stage. Moreso, it would add more workload to  the existing school syllabus and this could consequently affect their overall academic performances in school; for instance, an increase in courses to offer without an extension in time.",
        "In conclusion, while teaching pre-university  student could be a useful skill in their adult lives. In my opinion,I agree it could deter them from focus on the vital courses ."
