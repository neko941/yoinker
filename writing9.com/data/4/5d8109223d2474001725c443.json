Some sociologists claim that parents and other members of society often set a bad example. Discuss the causes and some effects of widespread drug use by young people in modern day society. Make any recommendations you feel are necessary to help fight youth drug abuse.*",

        "There has been an increase in the rate at which young adult use illegal and legal medications. Many sociologist believe this is as a result of bad parental and societal influence. This essay intend to discuss the reasons attached to this increase and the adverse effect of drug abuse.",
        "The first reason is connected with the family - Neglect and poverty seems to be the reason why youth engage in drug abuse.",
        "In order for a child to grow up in a balanced way, it is very important that he or she is nurtured well by his or her parents. However, these days, it is often the case that children are neglected. This may be because of the fact that many parents in cities now both have to work so are often not around to give their children support when needed. This make the children result to drugs to curb the loneliness. Another factor is the increasing levels of poverty around the world. We have seen with globalization the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and this inevitably means that those who are poorer will have to resort to illegal means to get what others have. Of course, this will include the children in the poorer families selling drugs to make money in order to survive.",
        "The effect of drug abuse has been seen in different areas of live in our youth today.",
        "A major negative is the increasing level of mental cases recorded each year from drug abuse, a larger percentage which are occupied by the youth. This is because they are mostly the abuser of both legal drugs like tramadol, pentacozine and illegal drugs like cocaine and amphetamines.",
        "Furthermore, drug abuse has been statistical proven to be related to low IQ and a large rate of school- drop out. This was evidence by the recently published journal by the British Society of Psychology which showed that about 58% of high-school drop out can be attributed to drug abuse.",
        "In conclusion, Neglect and poverty seems to be the cause of drug abuse with low I.Q and illiteracy being a major downfall. To solve this, health education about these major effects of drug abuse in schools to our youth would go a long way in curbing this growing disease in our nation."
