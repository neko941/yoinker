        "Environmental nuisance to soil and water have been on the increase over the last two decades as a result of the increased usage of polythene sacs for shopping. Despite the advantage of its light weight,I strongly agree it should be made illegal so as to create a clean environment and encourage  the use of   better alternatives.",
        "Opponents of such a ban are of the opinion that they are more lighter in mass.People find it convenient using them because they are easier to carry and thus cause less burden.For example,a single polyvinyl chloride bag is known to weigh 50mg while paper bags are known to weigh much more.",
        "However,banning them would be more beneficial.One advantage of such a ban is that it would create a better surrounding.These bags plastic bags are known to litter the environment and in turn cause clogging of drainage pipes and proliferation of flies.For instance,a recent research showed that 80% of blocked drains are caused by them.",
        "Also,if they were stopped from being used,they would encourage the use of better options.Supplementary items like paper bags are more environmental friendly and cheaper.A case in point was a study which found out that they are less likely to cause land and water contamination.",
        "In conclusion,despite the fact that plastic bags are known to be of lighter weights,I strongly support it's use be stopped as it would create healthier  surrounding and also make way for cleaner option like paper bag.This would benefit the individual and community in the long"
