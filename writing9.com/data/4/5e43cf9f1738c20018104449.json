        "In recent years, the impacts of television`s ubiquity on cultural development have sparked a heated debate in many countries. Whereas some argue that video programs are conducive to cultural influence opponents disagree. My personal sentiments are on par with the former contention.",
        "Firstly, the educational function of television is well recognised, since a picture is worth a thousand words, the documentary programs are advantageous for audiences to understand complicated cultural concepts. Nowadays, an overwhelming majority of national channels have produced plenty of TV shows rite with traditional elements. By these, the treasured heritages are able to be transmitted to the next generation.",
        "Secondly, culture as an integral soft power of a country is being spread throughout the world by television series. The popularity of Korean romantic shows exemplifies this precisely. Korea has been equipped with enormous soft power in international politics.",
        "Notwithstanding, the associated negative impacts should not be underestimated. The violent and sexual contents could leave audiences with a bad impression of the country and the culture. Taking Mexico as an example, those who are not familiar with its culture might think it is a country in fraught with drugs and mafia if they based their knowledge on the limited TV programs they watched.",
        "Henceforth, it can be confidently concluded that television programs associated potential risks might do a disservice to the cultural impression. The positive contributions made by TV shows towards cultural development, however, outweigh the negatives."
