        "Nowadays, one needs to move to different cities in order to work. Although this is a present day job requirement, but it has adverse outcomes by affecting family life. Drawbacks of the situation will be shown by looking at the negative effects it has on children's personality and the parent-child relationship quality.",
        "For one, parents who do not tend to stay at home and travel a lot cause psychological pressure on their children. These children always have a sense of dissatisfaction and loneliness for the rest of their lives. For example, while working in China I taught English to the children of several dual income families. These children enjoyed staying alone and lacked confidence as well as they appeared to be anxious while participating in group activities. Thus, parents who move to other cities and leave their children alone for a time span as per their work requirement, hinder their younger ones development as a normal member of the society.",
        "In addition to this, Children with little or no family time owing to the traveling of their parents, have a weaker family bond. For instance, recent researches suggest that having a quality family time plays a significant role in the quality of relationship one experiences whereas, living alone without parents results in distance among family members.",
        "By following this look, it is clear that children whose parents do not stay at home suffer both in terms of worse psychosocial development and a weaker familial bond."
