        "It is thought by some that decisions concerning the company should be made by the managers, others however, are of the opinion that employees should be part of the decision-making process . In my opinion, I believe no one is an island of knowledge and as such employees should be involved in the decision making process.",
        "On one hand, some group of people have this belief that decision making should be the sole responsibility of the manager, as person in that position is considered to be well vast and experienced in all matters concerning the company. And he will be taking responsibilities for the decision if anyhthing goes wrong at the long run. This is why when recruiting managers, one of the key requirement listed is that the person should have atleast ten years working experience in related field this is to certify that the individual has the competence and knowledge to handle issues when the need arises.",
        "On the other hand, others are of the opinion that employees should be involved in decision-making process   and i agree with this.",
        "Firstly, no one is considered as an island of all knowledge and it is believed that when people reason together on issues the best decisions are always made as it is putting so many peoples thoughts and into consideration as there is no way all  their deliberations would not amount to something productive as it is putting alot of people's knowledge into usage.",
        "In conclusion, while many people vary in  their opinions , i believe that employees should be involved in decision making as no one is an island on its own."
