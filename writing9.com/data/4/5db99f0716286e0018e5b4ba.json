        "Punishing children at an early age to make them learn correct and incorrect actions is debatable. Some people think it is important to punish kids at small age to help them distinct or differenciate right and wrong acts. This essay will discuss why punishment is not the best option on small kids and would be appropriate only as a last resort.",
        "Explaining what they did and helping children identify their action by elaborating the effects caused by their actions would be best solution. Often shouting or yelling at a child on the instance of mistake committed, could put them in fearful state and might break their confidence. For example, a child might try to avoid something new or even skip a new task fearing that an unsuccessful outcome might cause them trouble or punishment. Proper explanation of consiquences would help them understand their mistake.",
        "Otherwise, showing the outcome of an incorrect action would help them adopt corrective measures easily. Instead, punishment could develope hatredness in the child and stop them from sharing things. For instance, an act of throwing an empty can on road, could be corrected by explaining the consequence of someone getting hurt or falling down by stamping over it. Making kids understand the outcome of wrong doings will help them realise the effects of their action.",
        "Punishment should only be a last resort for corrective action. However, parents or teacher can use the unharmful techniques such as no playing hour for a day or two, not allowing movies for a week, no outing or fishing on weekend and so on. Educating kids on effects of worng doings would creat a better understanding and help them learn why they should not do that. This essay concludes saying punishment is not the best method to help children learn right and wrong at an early age. Therefore, it is adivisable to use punishment as the last option, instead educating them on the outcomes of right and wrong acts would be the wiser decision."
