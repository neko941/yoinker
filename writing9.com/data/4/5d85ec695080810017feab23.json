        "I am currently an undergraduate student studying business administration at National Chung Cheng University and will graduate in June 2020. I have been interested in price setting strategies and the authentic advertisement since I was in junior high school. After I involved in various kinds of fields in university, I found that marketing is the field I am eager to acquire more. Although I had learned some related courses in university, it still makes me feel inadequate in this field. Therefore, I sincerely look forward to joining your university to enrich myself.",
        "I took various courses and extracurricular activities during my time in university to broaden marketing related knowledge and enhance personal skills. One of optional courses I took called \u2018Services Marketing\u2019, which foster my solid background knowledge about theoretical modules. In addition, I engaged in Certificate Program of the Applied Language Studies since second semester of 2016 and accomplished qualification within five semesters.",
        "This Certificate Program not only fosters my English academic reading and writing skills but also builds up presentation abilities through practical practices. Besides English courses, I also took Japanese courses in Certificate Program to develop third language skill. Because of this language capacity, I strived to seize an opportunity of being Japanese students\u2019 school mate in International Summer School in 2018. In such chance I learned how to promote our country\u2019s features to foreign visitors, which require the combination of marketing and language skills, and also try my best to overcome the language barrier and acquainted with other cultures.",
        "In the practical aspect of marketing, I was one of members in our department student association, we held the T4 Campus Marketing Case Competition which founded by ourselves, and I was part of the directors. This competition targeted in four specific national universities in the south of Taiwan and competitors had to figure out marketing plan to their appointed enterprise and were given the opportunities to fulfil their ideas. I assisted the operation of workshop and also tried to find out the marketing strategies and potential participants of this competition. Noteworthy, I was honor to be a master of ceremonies in the final round of the competition, which was a very valuable experience.",
        "Another role I served on department student association is the director of athletics. I coordinated each department sport teams with budget planning, it was a tough job because each team strived for maximizing their budget. At this time, I realized the importance of coordinated and persuasive skills to make the budget distribution fairly according to each team\u2019s individual situation.",
        "Besides academic performance, I participated in department volleyball team in my spare time. I was named by captain based on the respect and trust from my team mates, and performed leadership in team practice. The position of captain strengthened some of my personalities. This role enhanced my decision-making skills a lot. It can be exemplified by assigning starting lineup and substitution when we were in the competition, it is crucial that draw a line between friendship and strength, making a clear separation between public and private. Also, as a captain, it cultivated my personality to be consistent. During practicing, I realized that despite encountering the bottleneck was inevitable and feel depressed, perseverance is the key to overcome the difficulties.",
        "All of these extracurricular activities strengthen not only my individual skills such as communication and problem-solving skills in teamwork but also find my insufficient in marketing field. Therefore, I firmly believe that study postgraduate is necessary for me to acquire more professional knowledge in marketing.",
        "After my self-evaluation, the reason I decided to study in United Kingdom rather than in Taiwan is because it takes one year to finish master degree, I could have one extra year for me to explore myself compare to my peer studying in Taiwan. After finishing master degree, I plan to go to Japan to seek intern and cultivate my Japanese in order to enrich myself and broaden my horizons.",
        "Once I achieved my short-term goal, I would like to work in transnational company such as LEGO and Google. Although these company require high qualification, I will endeavor to develop multi-skills in postgraduate in order to make myself more competitive and reach the goal.",
        "I sincerely appreciate your consideration regarding my application and I look forward to hearing from you soon."
