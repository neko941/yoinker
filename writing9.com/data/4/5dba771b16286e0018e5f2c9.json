        "There are many reasons why the global warming is increasing. Firstly, Due to, deforestation, a number of trees is decreasing day by day. People are  encroaching this for either farming or building houses.  Since trees  have the ability to combat the level of Carbon Dioxide, deforestation greatly increases the carbon level in the atmosphere, which eventually resulting high temperature in the planet earth.  Another  point is taken into account is that,  the number of  vehicles is skyrocketing  nowadays, which are heavily depended on fossil fuels. These  fuels emit carbon footprints significantly, which also elevate atmosphere temperature.",
        "This is tackled by  the government initiatives. The public should be educated regarding the impacts of global warming and how can be tackled this properly. Similarly, the authorities require to implement new laws  against those who break the directives and punish them heavily by imprisonment and heavy penalties. Additionally, private vehicle owners will be asked to pay extra carbon taxes to cut down privately owned vehicles.  By allocating funds for the  reforestation, global warming can be controld  in the long run. Similarly, encourage the  public to minimize the use of single use plastics and motivate them to use recycled products."
