        "The given line graph indicates how many students completed their tertiary education between 1992 and 2007 in Canada.",
        "Overall, It is clear that although the number of graduates from Canada's universities had increased constantly, the number of students fell slightly during 1998-1999.",
        "In 1992, 70,000 male students were graduated, however, female students were far ahead, with near 100,000 in the same year. From 1995, the number of both sexes pupils started slightly declining, but after 2001, both male and female students' numbers were on constant rise till the end, with more than 90,000 and 148,000 respectively. Although there was a little fluctuation in the numbers between 1999 and 20000, the number of female students were mostly declined in 1999. Another small fluctuation can be seen in the year 2004 when the number of male graduates was 82,000, and females were near 128,000, which again gained momentum immediately after small hiccups. In the given period, more female students were graduated than males."
