        "With the advent of science and research, newer improving strategies have been introduced in the field of agriculture. However, despite of these advancements a large share of worlds population is still deprived of food. In my opinion global warming plays the key role in this and I would recommend introduction of new laws regarding environment protection.",
        "Global warming, the major contributing factor for adverse climate change, leads to a decrease in crop production. For Instance, In April this year, flood and thunderstorms have declined the state's revenue drastically, owing to the mass destruction of almost over 35000 acres of land in Pakistan. Following this look, it is clear that a far less crop production results from global warming which in turn causes food shortage.",
        "While looking out for solutions to tackle the situation, I personally feel that governments should impose laws that play a protective role for Earth's environment. For example, a recent research shows that the cultivation revenue was quite larger in the past century when we had a better climate and less global warming. So even if we make laws now, we can protect our planet from worst environmental changes and as a result can decrease the number of people suffering from hunger.",
        "To conclude, it is evident that how climatic variations have been linked to crop production and food shortage while following rules and regulations for saving environment from global warming can minimizes hunger and draught across the world."
