        "Whether young adults should obey the orders of the aged people or not is a hotly debated topic that divides people. There are some individuals who argue that the children should question the guidance from elders. In this essay we will discuss on when should a teenager obey the elders and when one shouldn't, followed my viewpoint and conclusion.",
        "Can anyone deny that fact that a persons age and their life experience is not directly related? No, it is irrefutable. Because of this reason, it is advised that school children should respect and accept the things that grand parents or other aged people tell them to do. Not only, it can help them in doing things easily but also save precious time. When I was kids my grandfather taught me abacus, it helped in doing my mathematics assignments with ease.",
        "On the other hand, when children near the adultolesence they should be willing to question on the matters that they are asked to follow. This is because, as they progress they will need to make some decision on their own and everytime they can't have access to elderly guidance. Although, not sticking to advices might result in some mistakes, it could serve as an opportunity to learn. A reasearch conducted by the Young Minds Associations found that young people who challenge the rules set by their grand parents are more succesful as professionals when they join an organisation.",
        "To conclude in my opinion, it is better to stick to what old people say at the beginning of tennage and towards the late end of teenage it is okay to find reason and debate on what one should be following."
