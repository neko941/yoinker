        "sports person. But in these away they only can learn things physically not by heart. Most of the",
        "time it becomes only leisure activity, not their passion.",
        "On the other hand, some peoples have intrinsic talent, got this through genetic legacy and that",
        "quality creates a humongous difference from others. Innate talent is one\u2019s own gift. The skill that",
