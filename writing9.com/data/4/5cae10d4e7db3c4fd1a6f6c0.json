Meanwhile, we see some politicians enjoying power well into their eighties. Clearly, there is little agreement on an appropriate retirement age.\n\nUntil what age do you think people should be encouraged to remain in paid employment?\n\nGive reasons for your answer.\n\nYou should write at least 250 words.",

        "Retirement is one of the main issue of modern society. This issue is not only common in poor countries but in well developed countries too. The retirement age is different in many countries. In my opinion retirement age should be after 50 years because it is hard to find a job after 50 years. The reason for this is that most of the employers prefer much younger employees. Another thing is changes in technology, society and so on. The knowledge and experience this people had during their whole life may not be relevant today. This makes it hard for them to get used to changes for example in work ethics. Also this make it hard for them to start new career from start. Now I heard many people claiming that people become rich after 50th or 60th by starting new career and I agree with that but the chances of getting such success in late adulthood is quite few.",
        "Another reason for why people should get retired earlier is mortality rate. Now the average mortality age in many countries varies from 60th to 80th years and setting retirement age after 60th is seems unwise because some people couldn\u2019t live up to their retirement. So letting them retire after 50th gives them chance to spend their last year in peace because nobody wants to spend their last year working in office. But after retirement these people should have chance to work if they wanted to or if they have job offer.",
        "In conclusion, as I said retirement is very complicated process for government or social organization I guess the reason for some countries to raise retirement age is because they might not have enough money to provide."
