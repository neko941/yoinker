        "The rapid development of the technology has brought about various merits to community, especially the e-shopping industry. In synchronization with the advantages, the cybercrime, is the online fraudulent, is the most worth-concerning drawback of this factor. From my own perspective, there are a lot of ways to solve it.",
        "When it comes to purchasing goods online, individuals play an important role in preventing themselves from the scammers. The plain truth is that they should do more scrutiny on the sellers who they make a deal with before paying money for the products. Thanks to this way, they could be able to not only choose the qualified items but also avoid the deceptive e-sellers. For example, No sooner had they spent time on reading other customers\u2019 review on Shopee, the giant commercial website in Vietnam, than they could distinguish the scammers from the reliable sellers. Therefore, they could receive the real products with the high qualification after sending their private information or bank account.",
        "On top of that, the stricter legislation enacted by the website would alleviate this severity. To be more specific, the freedom and easiness in registering to be an online seller has aroused an opportunity for these fraudulent on the Internet. Facebook, for instance, where e-customers loss their money for deceptive or exaggerated items monthly has become the unreliable online market because everyone could join in the groups of sellers without having a business registration certificate. Henceforth, the cybercrime will not emerge if this practice takes place.",
        "As aforementioned explanations, these such efficacies, carried out by each individual and website controller, would limit or even halt the emergence of the cybercrime."
