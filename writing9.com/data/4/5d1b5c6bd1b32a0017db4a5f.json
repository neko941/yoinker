        "Almost everyday television programs show scenes of violence, it is normal see armies and cruent images in computer games too. The audience is divided, someone says that the view of these scenes damage the behaviour of society, someone else admit that the violence seen on TV does not have any negative effects on people. I think that an adult person is able to divide the reality from the fantasy, so, if he has an educational and cultural background there is no risk that he will imitate what he has seen. The younger, especially kids, are more inclined to copy some actions, for this reason i guess is important control what they watch.",
        "Nowadays media are full of violent scenes: video of fights recorded by mobile phones or film\u2019s parts. Is possible see brutality everywhere and there are some people that used to imitate what they see. This inclination worries someone but I think that the solution is not delete every form of violence from screens. If an adult man has received a good education he will know recognize what is wrong and dangerous for his life and for people\u2019s life who are around him.",
        "According to me these continuous displaying of violence could have negative effects on children. They start to play at videogames when are really little and learn from these the existence of weapons. They learn to use mobile phones very early and now on internet is possible to find everything. They could watch tutorials about the use of guns or videos that show moments of bullying made by younger people. They will grow thinking that the violence is the normality. The quick fix is not denying the use of technology but check what they do and explain them what is right and what not.",
        "To conclude I think that could be appropriate reduce scenes of violence, but with a right education the risk that these affect on behaviour is reduced."
