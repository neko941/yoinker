        "Government wants a lot of money on arts. These arts might include creating new statues, decorating walls of stadiums. I think this money could be used in lot of better ways.",
        "Money that government uses is hard earned money by common people that should be utilized on them, instead of wasting it on stone sculptures. These sculptures are not going to be useful for anyone, these are just a showpiece by government. Even after wasting enough money on these arts, more of it is wasted on throwing parties for their inaugrations.",
        "This money could be utilized in a lot of better ways, specially for a developing country, there are lot more important things to be taken care of. Most efficient use will be to spend this on the education of upcoming generation, that is going to be the building blocks of our country. And spending some on the poor people for creating shelters or on creating small jobs, so that they can take care of themselves and their family.",
        "Arts is also an important factor for attracting tourism in our country, but for that instead of creating new sculptures, they should be concentrating more on the already existing monuments like Taj Mahal. These monuments are already famous worldwide and attract a lot of tourism, so instead of letting them getting deteroit, money should be spent for taking proper care of them.",
        "Hence spending money on arts is important, but spending too much is a waste of hard earned money, which could have been utilized on better purposes."
