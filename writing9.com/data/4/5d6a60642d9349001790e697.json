        "The world is changing over time. All the changes will impact the human behaviour and new things to be added to their life. In simple terms, people are willing to live in an easy going life and seeking more effecient and effectives ways of performing all the activities performed mannually in the past. Hence, the technology plays a vital role in this era to comfort the human requirements. This essay will explain how the classroom teachers are replaced by the technology.",
        "During the period of 1990, most of the school used a simple teaching equipments such as blackboard, tables, chairs, text books, pen and pencils. When compared with the current technology, most of places you may find that those items used in 1990, has been replaced by laptops, projectors, flash drives, internet and online reading. This was mainly due to the enhancement of ways of delivery in teaching.",
        "We are living in a dynamic environment which requires to use most recent technology when we are learning. This is also due to the high market competition in terms of education and job requirements. Therefore, the role of teachers also changed over the period with the enhanced technology. Student had limited resources in old years whereas in this modern world there are number of opportunities and resources available to substitute the traditional teachers. Those old years teachers used to provide all the information required to learn by the student accordingly to the syllabus given by some authority. This teaching method is completly limiting the exploration of other details beyond the traditional syllabus. On the otherhand the teaching subjects are very subjective in one country to other country which may lead to the knowledge gap between the contries. However, these issues have overcame by modern technology by using the internet which leads to the redution of the knowledge gap between two countries.",
        "Since the role of a teacher changed drastically over the period, present status of teachers also moving to advisor, supporter or instructor instead of traditional teachers who used to stand infront of the class and teach. Based on the most recent researches showed that there is no more teachers in modern schools but instructor or lecturer. The main reason is that the subject matters are readily available in the virtual resources and not required to spend unnecessory times by travelling and sitting in an ordinary class room.",
        "In my personal opinion, I agree to the point that the classroom teachers also will be replaced by the technology."
