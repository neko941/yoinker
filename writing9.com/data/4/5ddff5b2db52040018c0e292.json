        "The technological advancement plays a crucial role in peoples' communication as it does in many parts of our lifestyle and it has become a common practice among people to build new friendships via digital media. It is stated that the internet is the best method to make new relationships, while others insist that the real world interaction is irreplacable. Both sides of this controversial issue will be discussed in this essay and a final conclusion will be drawn.",
        "On the one hand, people argue taht the use of social media for the purpose of making new relationships have made our life more easier. By means of a variety of mobil applications and websites people spend less time to contact with each other than they used to several decades ago. Needless to say, they do not need to travel long distances to see each other to have a conversation. Furhtermore, the digital world make a way particularly for introvert people to express their feelings, emotions and ideas more easily and without getting stressed behind the keyboard compared to face-to-face interaction.",
        "On the other hand, it is believed that the communication over social networking can never be considered as a complete replacement for communication in person. The conventional method of earning new friend is regarded as a more favorible option to make a strong and long-lasting relationships, Moreover, the identity of unfamiliar person can never be totally trustful, which makes it dangerous to share your personal information with them via internet. It can result in undesirable consequences, such as loosing money from a bank account in case of giving access to such unknown people for the relevant information.",
        "In conclusion, the conveniency and easy to use behaviour of the social media as a communication tool is undeniable, although is has a hazardous effects in some cases. In my view, the internet must continue to be cautiosuly employed to befriend with new people.",
