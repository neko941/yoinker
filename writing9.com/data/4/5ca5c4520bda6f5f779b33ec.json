        "On the one hand, taking up an occupation straight after finishing high school  can bring some advantages especially in term of  finance and practical experience.  Firstly, students can earn money and pay for their living expenses . Particularly in rural areas, parents cannot afford university tuition fees.  Furthermore, universities might be far from their home, hence, in addition to tuition fees, they need to cover other expenditures such as house or apartment rent . Secondly, following this way, the young can gain empirical knowledge. For example, working as waiters can help youngsters know how to serve customers to meet their satisfaction. Moreover, they will involve in cooperating with others in working places , which is a necessary skill for adult\u2019s lives.",
        "On the other hand, I am convinced that pursuing a higher degree is a wider  choice. To begin with, I believe that knowledge and skills from schools are not enough to  guarantee a successful career.  It is a fact that  employees holding high school diploma only just find handworks . To get professional works such as marketers or bankers, a Bachelor\u2019s Degree  is a compulsory requirement of all employers. Nonetheless,  affiliate intellectual industry  has grown rapidly and robots promisingly replace manual labor in the near future. As a result, unskilled employees might lose their jobs and live in poverty.",
        "In conclusion, it appears to me that even working right after graduation might be helpful in several situations, broadly speaking,  juveniles should continue to study which is  the shortest path to obtain promising jobs."
