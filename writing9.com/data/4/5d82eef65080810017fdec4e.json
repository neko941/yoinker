        "It has been proposed that global sportive events, such as, football and Olympics are quite helpful in normalizing the diplomatic crisis among the nations. Not only that, these events are of vital importance in providing a way to dissipate the emotions, which individuals usually possess for the love of their countries. This essay will provide evidence in support of the afore mentioned concept and the final position will be declared in the conclusion section of this discussion.",
        "Nowadays, it can be witnessed that there is an exponential rise in disputes among various nations, all over the world. There is multitude of underlying factors for this, such as, wars an backlashes over economic gains. The leaders of countries, in order to attain their goals and highlighting their rightfulness of opinions try to manipulate the emotions of the lay man: of their own as well as of the opponent country, by giving speeches with international media coverage. As a consequence of practice like this there is noticeable escalation in civic virtues among the general populations. So everyone wants to do something for for the love and welfare of his country by putting his efforts in.",
        "In order to serve one\u2019s country and to prove his loyalty and support, people need a forum. Obviously , not everyone could go on war. So there must be some right way without any catastrophic results. Therefore, sportive festivals provides a great opportunity to the patriotic to express there devoted love for their country. Where they can openly express their selves in support and in oppose: for there own and opponent country, respectively. Thus, events such like these are great route to be emotionally honest without any harmful consequence.",
        "After analyzing the above, it can be concluded that sportive occasions are essential for preventing the diplomatic ties of breaking due to international tensions and providing a way out to the bottled up emotions to be released. It is for these reasons, I completely agree with the statement provided."
