        "In today\u2019s generation where technology is making the life easier of humans, slowly the computers are taking over teachers in the classrooms. As nowadays students are getting more and more comfortable with the Hi-tech methods of education the part of teachers in the classrooms are declining. This essay will show how computers will steal the role of teachers in education methods.",
        "It started from the era when computers & internet began. There was a time when internet was used to make our work easier & soon it started taking over the human manpower. Computers helped us to simplify our work and complete our work in lesser time. Google played a major role in our education system, to find answers to every question related to any topic and subject.",
        "Soon there will be a time where computers, kindle, I-pads, & other knowledge giving robots will be left instead of human teachers. Nowadays students prefer to ask internet about their doubts instead of asking their teachers. YouTube is a big example where people have started learning things at their comfortable time and place. Free access of education on any topic available on internet is much likeable to the students now.",
        "To conclude, students are getting more used to computers than their actual mentors in the means of education. The position of teachers in the classrooms is automatically diminished. This clearly depicts that soon it will be taking over the teachers and will proof how the technology wins over the method of human education in the classrooms."
