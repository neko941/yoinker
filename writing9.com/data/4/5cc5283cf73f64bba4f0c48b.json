        "In this world of contradiction of opinions and actions, on the one hand it is often said that sports is a vital phase of school life for Kids and youth, while, other people believe that sports have various negative effects. This essay will discuss why enhancing sports is important initiative even if it is criticized in many aspects by opponents and considered as a waste of time.",
        "The proponents believe that  sports encourage us to maintain healthy life. For example, in today's technology focused world, it seems complex to have excessive time for sport, but practicing sport when we are children trigger us to accustomed to that routine. Another point, the world have been connected together through sports.  Without sports, the world will continue separated leading to insulation. If countries were not sharing sports with the world, it would appear isolated. Finally, it opens the gate for talented sporters to be discovered. These benefits are convincing to supporters.",
        "By contrast, sports take up time which might confront student from completing their studies. Sports have number of drawbacks range from wasting time and usefulness. It might be true that a sport by no means is significant to our life especially for children, but it might result in wasting time leading to failure. For example, children who do not have talents in sports and prefer academic life instead, they can consider sports as a waste of time and useless. A Further well observed question to sports is the moral scandals inherent to it which could be inappropriate example for children to follow suit. It seems to Opponents that it may be true that sport is important but it is outweighed by number of negative aspects.",
        "Overall, it seems reasonable to encourage children to play sports as long as we raise awareness to them regarding time management, and ethics."
