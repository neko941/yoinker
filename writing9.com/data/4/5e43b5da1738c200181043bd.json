        "It is true that online courses have become increasingly popular amongst university education system. Although there are some drawbacks of Internet-based education I would argue that there are far more benefits.",
        "The main drawback of the trend towards online university courses is that there is less direct communication. Students who study online cannot come into contact with each other or with teacher. Because these learners may lack the motivation and elements of competition. This could have a negative impact on peer support, discussion and exchange of ideas. For example, students who study on traditional courses have opportunity to face-to-face attend seminars.",
        "Despite the negatives mentioned above, I believe that Internet-based education courses in university are a positive development for various reasons. Firstly, in order to give them opportunity for whenever and wherever is convenient to do their work, they allow  students to learn in a flexible way. Secondly, online university courses lead to healthy competition to advancement in education system. Finally, student's age, ability location and background absolutely irrelevant  for online learning. For exemplify, my aunt who is fifty five years old, has recently entrolled on an online cooking courses which is located in foreign country. The cost of the university education is at a reasonable price for my aunt. She attends lessons three times a week by the internet. It would have been impossible in the days before internet -based education.",
        "In conclusion, while I recognize possible disadvantages of online learning, I consider it to be a positive development overall.",
