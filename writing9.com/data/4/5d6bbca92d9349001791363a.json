        "Being born with some innate ability is a norm for some individuals. In contrast, it is argued that being an expert in sport or music cannot be learnt. I believe talent is not enough to become a good athlete or musician but constant practise which is a means of perfection is what is needed.",
        "One major skills to be successful in the entertainment world is perfection which is a reflection of constant practise because it is fuelled by interest. For example, legends in entertainment such as Micheal Jackson; a musician and Mike Tyson a hero in sport, claimed to be driven by their passion and not talent. Due to this internal motivation, they were able to set world record which makes them Masters in these field.",
        "However, the role of innate ability in being a good athlete or artist cannot be disputed. Talent is a fraction of an individual that cannot be eradicated but a talent not ignited or practised will yield no result. For example , a study conducted by an African country revealed that most of the adults, wile at tender age are seen with certain abilities such as high speed in  running errands by foot but these skills which are unlearnt wear out as they grow because of their unsupportive environment to develop these abilities to perfection.",
        "In conclusion, while talent is Paramount in the foundation of being a very good athlete or musician, constant practise is the major key in being successful in these fields."
