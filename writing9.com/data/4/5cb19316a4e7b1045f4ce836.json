        "Leisure activites hold a vital place in everyone's life. Generally, people choose these activites on the basis on their own taste and preferences but nowadays, due to drastic shift in lifestyles and updating systems, these activites have also changed according to ongoing trends. I completely agree that presently fun related activites are undertaken merely to show off status and attract people around.",
        "Admittedly, people in current society are more interested in those hobbies which are famous and are performed by their celebrites. This makes them feel up-to-date with latest styles and trends. For instance, having gymnasium membership is considered to be a most prefered things among young adults as they watch movie stars with attractive workout clothes doing exercise there.",
        "Another reason which incites people to take fashionable activites is the constant peer pressure. It has been seen in many people, especially children,compel parents to enroll them in some unusual area of activity just because their friends are doing the same. For example, my 15 years old cousin started taking belly dancing lessons to participate in reality dance show, under the influence of one of her classmate.",
        "In conclusion, due to advancements in technology, lifestyle habits of modern public have modified greatly. As a result, people choose those free time activites which are latest and are in demand and this make then more connected with others and appreciated in society."
