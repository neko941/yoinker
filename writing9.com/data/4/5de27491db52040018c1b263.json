        "Majority of masses so asserts that the use of computer in education industry has improved step by step .along with this , it also has it's reliable results, whereas others section of echelons believe that it has its negative impact. However, in my prospective, this statement needs further scrutinising before forming any view.",
        "First and foremost, computers have an access in winding the spectrum of knowledge of students. Computers are an effective technology which can increase the productivity of pupils. However, information can easily accessible on computer's  search engine  like Google. This suggests that observers do not have to struggle  in libraries to locate possible information. For this reason it is evident that computers have their vital role to enhance their way of learning.",
        "With regards its ill effects, the enhancement of utilisation of computer could hamper the students performance. Computers which are widely acceptable for study purpose are not accessible to students everywhere so that it would be difficult for students to cope up with the lessons learnt in the school. Eventually the learner will not be able to score appropriate marks in their exam.all in all , this reason depicts that the use of computers may put pupils in delicate.",
        "In conclusion, contributing of computers in education has some of its downfalls, but because of its effectiveness it can be said that these technological gadgets have their positive effects on student's learning ability."
