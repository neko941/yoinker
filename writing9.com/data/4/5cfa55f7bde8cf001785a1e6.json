        "Technological developments, especially computers and internet, have changed our lives substantially in the last three decades. Starting from the introduction of the first desktop computer, through the development of the laptops and smart-phones, and up to the new smart-watches and personal online assistance such as amazon's Alexa, it seems as though the internat and computers have taken over our lives.  These devlopments have profound impact on our sociaty and the effects can be seen more and more. Many people loose there jobs to computerized machinary who can perform the required tasks faster and more accurate. Classic examples include amazon's computerized storing facilities as well as the motor industry which have become almost completely hands free. These changes ocure not only in the industrial field but effects all types of jobs from medicine to education.",
        "The effects computers have on education and data aquisition is enormous. Student's can gain massive amount of information in secoonds and there is no limit to the amount of data that can be obtained. These changes have raised fundumental questions in regards to the role of teachers in the education of generations to come. Some believe that the classical teaching paradigm of frontal lectures is obselet and soon will not be needed. This is because, unlike in past years, all the data is stored online and there is no need to pass information verbaly. Furthermore, not only that people do not need oral lectures, they can even learn online how to gain the required information.",
        "Despite the increasing use of computers I believe teachers will always be needed. This is because computers will never be able to replace a human touch or gesture. The internet will never be able to replace a smile or a hug and education can not rely only on hard facts. True education also include emotional safety and astbility as well as a worm touch. Computers will become an integral part of formal education but will only assist the teachers, not replace them."
