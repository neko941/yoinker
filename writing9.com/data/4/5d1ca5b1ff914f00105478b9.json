        "Nowadays, Poverty became an serious issue, across the globe. Different countries deals, with the issue, in different ways. Lets discuss few of them as below.",
        "Primarly, we discuss about the reasons of poverty. First and foremost is population. Due to increase of it, available resources won't be enough for all the people. For example, food from farming can be sufficient for fewer people, with an increase of head count, it can't be available for all. Second, Literacy, number of educated resource's, can be major deciding part of the cause. The more the literates, then the more income levels. For example, In the family, if couple are educated then they tend to do job, so do the income. If one, then income level will be less.",
        "Coming to the solutions, Government should take necessary actions, to control the growth of their citizen statistics. For example, making an advertise in public media, regarding the issues of the increase. Second, They should be given some basic aid in health, education and housing. For example, If they are provided with free schooling, upto some standards, then they can get in job and start providing income.",
        "In Conclusion, It's not only the responsibility of the people representative, but also each one of us, to eliminate the problem for the better society."
