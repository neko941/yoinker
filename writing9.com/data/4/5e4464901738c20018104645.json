        "Outlaws in prisone have been the center of many debates that aims to enhance the cities safety. Dealing with the best punishment for them divided many people. It's agreed that making them do community work for free is the best solution, because making them do good deed will make them more considerate and doing so will be useful for the community.",
        "Firstly, mating a person who broke the law do charity work for the community will push them to being more empathetic. For instance, the university of Toronto published study tndte which stated that did something good for others without any exchange were much less likely to do something bad of illegal in the future. When helping someone it's always changing something deep in ourselves that push u to be better people.",
        "Secondly, for prisoners to do free work will always help the city and people by mitigating the cost of some projects on the government",
        "for example in the 11th century china used their own captured Criminals to build the great wall of china. This action helped the chinese people survive many attacks that could many people. Thus this decision was very helpful for ching and",
        "its people than take the lives of just heeping the prisoners in their cells.",
        "To summarize, for many reasons like changing the prisoners personalities for the better while also helping the communities its fat better to go with making them do the community work instead of just keeping them in isolations.",
