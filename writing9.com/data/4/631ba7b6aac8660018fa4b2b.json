        "Now a days children can learn each and everything over Internet from their home, without actually having to go to school. In this essay I will discuss, to what extent this idea can use-full for school going children. Internet has many benefits one of them is to find the material to study your desired subject.",
        "I somewhat disagree with the idea of letting children learn through the internet  and not sending them to  institute  especially tho who have access to school and can have proper education there. No matter how much we learn from the internet in can\u2019t compete with an institution. Schools and institutions are not only limited to knowledge but they also help students learn social skills. They can make new friends in reality, they can get involved in physical activities like sports and athletics; which is not possible to do through the internet.",
        "The idea of gaining knowledge from the internet could be beneficial for those who can not attend school due to some un-fortunate reason, for them internet can play an essential role. Although the internet has a negative effect on young children it can be utilized for many purposes, like learning some special skills or making a new online friend. The Internet has plenty of interesting and useful content, my personal favourite is cooking videos.",
        "I believe the internet can be very used - full if utilized in an appropriate way, ,however there is no doubt that nothing can replace an educational institution because education is a basic right of every human being."
