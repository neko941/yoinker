        "The children are delicate tender buds of the society, who bloom under the shadow of the their parents and the society at large. A child\u2019s mind is a clean slate and its the parents job to inculcate good habits and etiquettes. Different people want their children to be competitive while others want their children to be cooperative to others. I would like my children to learn a cooperative dwelling but have a knack of competitiveness.",
        "Since man is a social animal and to live in a society peacefully one has to have a sense of cooperativeness and a sense to help others in the society. The child should inculcate gentle and polite mannerisms, and have a soft pleasing speech. For example there are so many road rage cases",
        "where even people are murdered, can be avoided by a polite talk and a humble admission, while being aggressive and rude can spoil the scenario.",
        "On the other hand being competitive is also necessary , as this brings out the qualities and the results which are not at all possible without a competitive environment. Aggression , competitiveness and desire to achieve greatness go hand in hand , but children should learn to control their aggression. This should a healthy competition where your aggression is directed to the competition and not the competitor.",
        "Drawing the parallels, one should learn to be polite, humble , increase their patience and learn the habit of sharing and teamwork. For example any team game like football is a combination of competitiveness and cooperation, so should be our life.. a healthy game of life."
