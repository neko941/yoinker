        "Private cars should be taxed seriously, if nations want to really solve traffic issues. Funds generated from this should be used to provide affordable alternative such as rail. I strongly agree with this notion because firstly, rail transport can covary more commuters at once. secondly, the maintenance is cheaper and affordable.",
        "To begin with, the number of passengers that can be transported at once by train is enormous as such there will be drastic reduction in the figure of road users. Since heavy taxes on private car ownership will reduce the extent at which individuals own or use their cars, the road will be free from grid lock. In 2002, when private car owners were taxed heavily and commuters used rail as a means of transportation; the grid lock statistics plummeted within a year in China.",
        "Furthermore, the maintenance cost for rail transport is by far less to that of road. The cost of maintaining road is high because of the frequent repair required by it. While rolling stock infrastructures require less periodic maintenance there is need for constant repair of drainages, bridges and road surface maintenance which comes with very high cost. The use of private car taxes to provide this alternative means of transportation will reduce government spending on these roads.",
        "To conclude, for nations that are committed to resolving traffic challenges, I strongly agree that taxing private car owners and utilizing the funds to provide free or very affordable rail transport is a great way of doing so."
