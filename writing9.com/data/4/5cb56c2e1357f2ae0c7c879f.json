        "It is believed that removing non academic subjects at school syllabus can develop children to focus and excel academically. I completely agree that non-academic subjects should be eliminated so that kids can concentrate more academically. First, students can spend more time on academic subjects. Second, it can enhance more knowledge.",
        "Alloting more time on academic lessons can give students higher marks. They can spare more time on studying subjects more rather than spending it in non-academic one. If kids can focus on that aspect, it is more likely they will suceed academically. Recent survey shows that kids focusing more on major subjects is said to be more successful in profession as they are more exposed in their field.",
        "In case of removing non-major subjects in the curriculum, it is understood that University will impart more knowledge to students as replacement of it. It is beneficial since students will be now more exposed in actual studies and learn more theoritically. The school will add more activities in related to academic subjects which was not included in students school guidelines as it is loaded. To exemplify, students who learned online focuses more on academic subjects and can choose as well as focus only to the course they wanted to.",
        "In conclusion, students who wish to suceed academically can eliminate non-academic subjects at the syllabus as it is not essential as a part of learning. It maybe a distraction since kids need to focus and know enough ideas to become a successful one."
