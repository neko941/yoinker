        "Visiting countries has become a recent and popular trend that allows people to experience some new thing such as trying different food or sightseeing cultural monuments. While some people claim that travelers should obey to the host's culture and their habits, others consider accepting international differences important.",
        "On the one hand, once someone said: \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\" That actually means to accept the local heritage, traditions and behaviours as ours while staying at a particular place. Firstly, in order to be a real traveler, you should follow local customs and behaviours. Additionally, just reverse situation and imagine yourself as a host, the first thing that you would appreciate is the respect that visitor has shown to your culture. Secondly, while accepting host's cuisine and habits, traveler can achieve quality knowledge and get unique experience that will remind them on particular trip. Lastly, trying new things and following local traditions make us better people.",
        "On the other hand, hosts should also have a respect for visitors' culture and behaviour. Nowadays, differences are usual and since many people travel regularly, all cultures and behaviours are combining and interacting on regular basis. Moreover, many people live in foreign countries and local citizens have accepted their traditions. What is more, not everybody are comfort with trying different food or accepting other religions because of the respect to their own culture.",
        "In conclusion, both statements have advantages. In my opinion, if someone wants to travel, they have to accept host's behaviour and follow their traditions. In order to gain an amazing experience from a trip, visitors should try local things such as food."
