        "The pie graph illustrates that overgrazing, over-cultivation, deforestation and a few other factors are responsible for the decline in the productivity of the agricultural land, whereas the table shows these effects region wise in 1990. The units are measured in percentages.",
        "Overall, the main factor responsible to decrease the production of land worldwide is overgrazing. The region most commonly affected is Europe, whereas the effect on the North America is the least.",
        "On the one hand, 35% of the earth's area used for growing crops is being destroyed by the grazing of animals. Moreover, cutting of the trees and over cultivation account for the destruction of 30% and 28% of the productive surface respectively. Miscellaneous factors responsible are about 7% of the total.",
        "On the other hand, the destruction of land categorized continent wise has revealed that Europe is being targeted the most (23%), while the Oceania and the North America are 13% and 5% respectively. In Europe, deforestation is highest (9.8%), whereas  overgrazing is the lowest, that is just 5.5%. The main reason for destruction in the North America is deforestation (3.3%). Overgrazing is affecting the Oceania the most, that is 11.3%."
