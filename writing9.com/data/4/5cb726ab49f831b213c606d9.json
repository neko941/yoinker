        "It is irrefutable that stress related illness are increasing rapidly. In this essay I intent to discuss its causes including increased working hours and bad diet. This essay will further explore some solutions to increased stress related illness, like work-life balance and good healthy diet.",
        "In this competitive world, people are supposed to work hard to maintain or to get a higher position. An Important reason for burgeoning stress-related illness is that in a typical corporate world People are assigned with more jobs than their capacity due to which they are enforced to work for extra hours. For instant companies fire their employees if they failed to meet their sales target. Sometimes people choose to climb the corporate ladder for social status at a cost of imbalanced work life.",
        "Another main reason for stress related illness is that people are less conscious for their eating habits. We are living in a consumerist culture therefore to meet with their needs people are becoming workaholic. So people are less concentrating on their diet and becoming more reliable on ready cooked food instead of homemade healthy diet.",
        "To resolve the issue under consideration one should reach in to the roots. Firstly people should themselves decide their work balance ratio and also give priority to their family, friends and relatives. Secondly along with work people should spend their few hours of a day for some physical exercise, meditation, etc and also follow healthy eating habits. Thirdly and most importantly government should also form some rules and regulations maximum working hours, balanced working life and human rights.",
        "In recapitulation, I reiterate that in this fast life style stress related illness are rapidly growing. This essay discussed main reasons for this are increased work pressure and wrong eating styles. Further also suggested some ideas to resolve this problem in twofold: focusing on work-life balance and healthy food diet plans."
