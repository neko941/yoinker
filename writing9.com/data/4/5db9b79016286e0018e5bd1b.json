        "In the current modern world  due to several factors the current population has  improved life expectancy, hence some people say that the retirement age of the people should be increased. The access to the world of information which has made people more aware and advancement in medical sciences have helped people to an increased life expectancy.",
        "If we compare to 3 or 4 decades back more people have access to better medical facilities and access to clean water and sanitation  . The people are more informed hence, the dieseases are also being detected at earlier stages and hence not turning fatal. Several factors have resulted in the average age of population to increase on the universal level.",
        "But it's also important to understand that whether just increase in the life expectancy is enough or do we need to also look at the quality of life people have during these time periods.",
        "We come across a lot of mental and physical illness in people after age of 60 which were not the case before as we see more people living after 65 and hence it become very crucial that we keep in account how healthy people are in their old age and are they fit enough mentally and physcially to work for more years.",
        "In the end I would say that with increasing life expectancy and more need for financial support, average retirement age should be increased as the people in these age group are in need of more help and people are healthy enough to contribute at various levels."
