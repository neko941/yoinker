        "The twenty - first century is already turning out to be the century of the Internet. One of the growing areas of concern is that of Internet addiction. An Internet addict is someone who is unable to control his or her own use of the Internet and whose behaviors threaten to overwhelm his or her normal life. My essay will discuss solution to Internet addiction.",
        "The first possible solution to deal with Internet addition might be to restrict the use of mobile phone. In recent years, people should take part in other activities such as: listening to music, playing guitar, playing football,... Moreover, people can join some clubs in order to improve their communication instead of Internet addiction.",
        "A second measure to combat adiction would be to provide more job opportunities for addict. This means that addict has to work hard in order to forget to acess the Internet. In addition, people can take part in some social activities such as doing charity, voluntary work in the community so as to  be taken away from the computer screen and relax their mind.",
        "Finally, this problem could be addressed by educating. People should take care their lives.",
        "They need to heighten public awareness of addiction problems. Because it has been a head-aching issue in recent years.",
        "In conclusion, the above - mentioned facts have outlined the measure of this issue. The presented suggestions would be very good steps toward solving them. People should have further consideration on this issue."
