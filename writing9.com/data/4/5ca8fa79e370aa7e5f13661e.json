        "The number of people who are visiting places with extreme climatic conditions like the Antarctica and the Sahara Desert have been increasing like never before. There are pros and cons for the tourists, who are willing to visit such locations.",
        "Lets us start with pros, travelers who go to such places will see and experience the nature\u2019s beauty in its raw form. They will be able to feel how it is like to lead a life in such tough environments and when they return to home, the moments will be cherished for life. Going through such an adventurous and treacherous journey will improve self-confidence and sense of achievement.",
        "The main disadvantage of going such places is poor safety. Since the conditions are extreme, without proper gear, it can be life threating, in most cases emergency medical help is always far from reach. As per the statistics, dehydration in desert areas due to extremely hot weather is the main cause of death. Similarly, in Antarctica the temperature is always way below zero degrees, these freezing conditions can lead to frost bites and in some cases it can be death.",
        "Apart from Antarctica and Sahara they many other places which dangerous for the humans to travel. Taking Himalayas as an example, Mount Everest is the famous mountain on earth due to its height. Travelers, whoever reaches the top will turn in to celebrities, as it is one of the unforgiving peak to concur. At the same time, many people lost life while trying to scale that peak. Since Everest is almost 28000 feet, oxygen levels will be low, this can lead to death, if the person is not properly trained and equipped."
