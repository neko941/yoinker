        "Focussing on the Active X and Net, the former started its growth at approximately 600000 downloads and continued this, until the  fourth week, when there was  a slight dip before rising to its all time peak, just above 1200000. This remained most popular computer throughout the period. The latter,  was the least preffered game among the group; however, initially this was downloaded by just 4000, then it started to decline till third week, since then it picked up its rise and finished at around 50000 downloads per week.",
