        "People believe that these days recruiters prefer candidates with university degrees than hands-on experiences in life personal qualities. I believe there is variety reason for this and how positive effect this trend proves to have on our society.",
        "There are reasons why employers think that formal qualifications are necessary in recruiting employees. Universities offer an interactive learning environment where learners not only acquire theoretical knowledge but also cultivate practical skills in their field. Young people with tertiary education have the access to the knowledge in their major, at the same time they get the chance to nurture their essential skills in the area they want. As a result, these candidates proved to be skilled workers with well-educated profile that recruiters are looking for when they want to find new employees.",
        "This trend also brings out positive effect for the development of society. First of all, it encourages young people to pursue higher education and gain insight about the career they want to follow, it also helps raising the chance in their career prospect. The fact that more people attending university will also contribute in the society, for example, the work forced of the our country would be beneficial because of large number of educated and well-informed labors.",
        "In conclusion, there are many causes leading to this trend, it proves this trend bring outs the most beneficial effect to our community than drawbacks, more and more individuals should be encouraged to pursue tertiary education."
