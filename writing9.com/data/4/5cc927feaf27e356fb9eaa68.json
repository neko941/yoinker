        "These days both parents work to cover all life expenses leads to some of them to send their children who are in pre-school age to childcare center to recive a better level of care .On other hand, parents prefer to leave their children with grandparents to get best career.Personally, i would argue that the best choice is to send the kids to childcare centers.",
        "Those that who support care through childcare centers due to several reasons.Firstly, they claim that centers contribute of teaching children many skills and help them to improve their abilities mentally and physically by using toys as gadegets of education and do alot of activites such as singing, painting dancing which are allow them to communicate with other .In addition, they think it is the safest option owing to the fact that parents put the safety and childre's health at the first.another important considration is costs.",
        "Although these benifites of childcare centers but still some of them feel satisfied when send their childern to grandparent house during working days because they have a broad experience in displinary of children and dealing with them .More over, grandparents are the second closest persons to grandchildren after their parent so they give them alot of love ,safety and care.",
        "to conclude, i belive that the advanteges of these centers clearly owiegh the benifits of using relatives ,however, i still see grandparents is the best second family of caring children."
