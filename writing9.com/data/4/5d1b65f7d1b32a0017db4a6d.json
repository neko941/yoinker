        "Physical education programs are having paramount importance in school curriculum, therefore, there have been a number of given opinion, that physical education should be compulsory because of its mental and physical health benefits for a student, however, some oppose it. I will discuss both types of opinions before conclusion.",
        "To begin with, undoubtedly, it has been proved that physical activities are the part and parcel of healthy life. Students who are exposed to these types of physical exercises can increase their stamina and resistance power. According to medical science, Strong immune system helps to prevent from certain diseases like diabetes, obesity and indigestion. It not only improves stamina of body but also make one mentally strong. Besides that, A recent study has revealed that indulgence in these activities do not let the students to sneak time for electronic gadgets.",
        "Furthermore, physical programs are very helpful in inculcating the values of team spirit, cooperation and coexistence. Therefore, the array of benefits make it inevitable part of the school\u2019s curriculum..",
        "On the other hand, there are the situation and certain circumstances when physical program needs to be sacrificed. Students with certain disability and illness somehow should not be forced to be the part of this. Their impairments prevent them to be active and physically enthusiastic. Indeed, there is requirement to have it optional but it is also imperative to understand that they should be equipped with any other educational aspects like computer numeracy and soft skills.",
        "In conclusion, physical education should not be optional since it provides physical and mental growth to a student but the circumstances of impaired candidates should be kept in view.",
        "Note:\u2013 To address each and every question in statement is highly advisable for high score.",
        "12. What are the main reasons and solutions for re-offend?",
        "Ans. Every country has its own laws to combat with crime and criminals. However, nowadays, it is quite apparent that many criminals repeat crime even after being punished. It has really become a matter of concern because of multiple reasons and according to me this kind of problem should be addressed immediately.",
        "To start with, undoubtedly, these criminals get influenced by many reasons like social isolation, unemployment, psychological disabilities and lack of education. Unfortunately, they are subjected to humiliations very frequently by society people that disturb them mentally and pull them in constant stage of depression. The imbalanced mental condition never let them get rid of criminal record. Moreover, their past criminal background leaves them in the lurch of unemployment. While finding no way to meet their both ends, they start following same path of destruction. Lack of knowledge and skills is the other most contributing factor.",
        "It is true that there is no problem without solution. The government should get up from long slumber and initiate rehabilitation programs for them in which they should be given vocational training for self-employment. The other sustainable approach is the psychological nourishment where they can be exposed to regular spiritual and religious lecture. That will help them to keep them away from criminal activities. Moreover, the individual should do something on grass root level by remaining sympathic towards them as Gandhi ji said; Hate the sin, not the sinner.",
        "Indeed, the aforesaid measures are highly required to curb this problem as stitch on time saves nine."
