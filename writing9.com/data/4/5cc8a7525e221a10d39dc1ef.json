        "Some school kids are taught monetary value and how to take special care of it, however, it is a major life skill that should be included in the school\u2019s curriculum and taught. This essay agrees that monetary value should be included in schools curriculum and taught as well because of its importance. In my opinion, teaching school kids monetary value will make them more responsible and also learn how to make money rather than been spoon fed.                            Firstly, responsibility goes a very long way in people\u2019s life and it helps Tom ow how best you can be put in charge of some things. The inclusion of monetary value in the schools\u2019 curriculum has made many kids responsible by knowing how best to take care of it, what is meant for and how to spend it. However, this has made them to be responsible to their various homes and country at large. For example, kids who are taught this skills are seen to hold better position in the future because they were exposed to the act of caring,keeping and spending at a very little age unlike there other counterparts who does not know what to do with it or how to care and keep safe which has lead to lavish spending.                Secondly, addition of monetary value in schools curriculum has made the kids to be taught how to make more money by their teachers rather than waiting to be given by their parents. Children are exposed at their stage to know that making money is their responsibility and not to be given at all times.  For instance, research shows that children who are taught the rudiment of money making become very rich and famous. while kids who are not tend to depend on them to feed their families and become a liability to the nation.                                                 To conclude, the inclusion of monetary value in the schools curriculum has helped to sharpen the mindset of kids thereby making them responsible to the nation"
