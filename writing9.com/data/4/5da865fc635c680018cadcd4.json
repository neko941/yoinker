        "As an avidly travelling person i consider myself questioning this very thought if  people like me and i are grown more tolerant and understanding. it is very true that people lear a lot through their journey outside of their own country perhaps this can be attributed to how they observe and learn different outcomes outside thier comfort zone.",
        "when you travel outside your country you meet a lot of indivisuals with different tolerance and behaviour levels as an outsider one would feel quite often be obliged to adjust themselves to the other person's level of understanding in terms of both tolerance  and behaviour. So it is quite evident  to say that one would tend to change and grow to be more tolerant and understanding .",
        "on a personal level people around me who have been abroad for a while and later return back home showed a different attitude and tolerance towards things in a positive manner . this could be attributed to being exposed to different cultures and ideas and self assessment of those ideas with your own understanding leading to a different level of understanding and openness. As an avid traveler myself people have conveyed to me positively about me being more tolerant and understanding ever since i have been outside the country ,which further has strengthened my assessment on whether i have changed . which leads to me to conclude by saying that travelling does infact make a person's personal development become more retrified and the person more  tolerant and understanding ."
