        "The topic is about the choices that are available to us nowadays. Having multiple choices is very important these days in any field of education or work.",
        "In the past, the opportunities available to people were very limited so there was no much scope for growth and development. For instance,  in the past students had very limited options for the field they want to choose and had limited universities or colleges offering a particular course.",
        "Nowadays since we have different choices it helps people to explore the opportunities available and brings the creativity out of people. Due to different roles available in the workplace, people can always explore the roles they want to work and select the desired one. According to the research, employees working in the same role for a long time reduces their productivity in long run. If there are opportunities available in the organisation it will help them to explore and learn new things",
        "Also, if there are no choices available, it might lead to monopoly which might further lead to increase in prices and demand for the same. For example, Bisleri captured the market when it was launched in the market first as there was no other company offering the similar product. But nowadays there are many other companies who are offering the same product. So, this has led to availability of choices among the same product. This also has led to decrease in prices and more options availability.",
        "So, it is very important to have different choices as it will help in the self-development and growth."
