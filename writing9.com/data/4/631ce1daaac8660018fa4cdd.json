        "Online translation of sport has become more frequent nowadays and the whole system of live events are affected by it. Making matches affordable is conducive due to attracting more sport amateurs and presenting great variety of sport but there are also drawbacks.",
        "One evident benefit to televised sport is that people who are not prone to sport may be encouraged to do it by watching these matches. In other words, the thrilling extracts which are widely shown on sport channels can attract people to do sport, become an amateur and lead healthier lifestyle. Another reason that online translation of sport is advantageous is that vast range of sport events are accessible to watch on different sport channels. Consequently, sport fans have a wide list of options to choose, also rare sport matches are accessible. With sport channels sport events are available and therefore there is no hurdle of time or location.",
        "On the other hand, there are obvious disadvantages of televised sport. Firstly, it is unfair for small sport clubs as they need to compete with large ones to present their matches online. It means that these sport clubs are suffering because of financial losses and decrease of viewers. Secondly, fewer people are attending live sport matches nowadays. This trend will continue because of dramatic rise of ticket prices leading to emptiness of stadiums. Availability of sport on television makes live events to lose their value not only for fans but also for top players as they receive larger salaries for translation of sport.",
        "All in all, while there are plus points of televised sport events, the significance of real matches may be lost as a result. Live sport is beneficial as it maintain fair between sport"
