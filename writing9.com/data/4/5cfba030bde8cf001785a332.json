        "In recent times, there have been massive development in internet and telecommunication sector of many countries. This has enhance social interaction among people. Although the use of internet and telecommunication devices is not without demerits, the advantages outweigh the drawbacks.",
        "Despite the complexity of telecommunication devices, the advent of internet has made social interaction easier and faster. For instance, within a split of seconds, communication between people in different parts of the world is possible through the use of phones and social networks. This was not feasible some decades ago when letter writing was the major means of interacting with those outside ones immediate surrounding. Furthermore, local and international business opportunities have been developed through the internet. For example, online shopping has afforded people the opportunity to shop from different parts of the world. This would have been difficult without the use of internet.",
        "However, people are now preoccupied with social networks and mobile phones, impairing interaction with their social and physical environment. Accidents, loss of local customs and values and marital disharmony are some of the consequences of addiction to modern telecommunication system.",
        "In conclusion, despite limiting the interaction with local environment, the use of internet and mobile phones have been more advantageous, as it makes communication easier and faster and it help promote commerce at the local and international level."
