        "Over  the  years, more privileged  countries  have  made  numerous  donations  for ones in need but the problem of poverty has not been solved yet.",
        "In  my  opinion, financial  assistance  is not  the  key. Finances  through  support  fromdeveloped  nations  are  usually received  by authorities,  organizations  or  even  worse by the government and in many cases the funds are not distributed adequately (if at all) to  the  people  who  are  starving,  who  do  not  have  the  resources  to  send  their children to school, who live in unstable houses or on the streets. Even if the support reached the people in need, the problem is solved only temporarily, because money is not forever. Furthermore, in a country that is desperately impoverished, and hasn\u2019t industry or infrastructure, what does money afford?",
        "Looking  further,  due  to  their  financial  status,  developed  countries  should  find  other methods of  assistance,  that  have  long  termobjectives  and  results..  One  solution might  be  to  invest  inlocal infrastructure  projects,  such  as building  schools  and paying  teachers  to  educate  the  children. History proves that a lack  of  education  is the  main  cause  of  many  problems,  from  poverty  to  wars.  This  way  the  future generations will be able tocreate a positive change, invest back into their country, transform it into a place worth living and make sure that they won\u2019t make the same mistakesas their ancestors who let the country down. In conclusion, I agree with the fact that rich countries should give other types of help to less stable and well off countries rather than financial aid, because money comesand goesas  the  wind  blows  and  knowledge  is  the  only  thing  that  remains,even when you\u2019ve got nothing."
