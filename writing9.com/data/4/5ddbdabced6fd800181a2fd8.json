        "World-life balance is a mandatory for every employee. Most of the employees cannot achieve work-life balance in their life. This essay will first discuss about, how work load and lack of planning in the workplace affect the work-life balance. Secondly, this essay will explain how these problems can be avoided through a well organised life.",
        "Allocating more tasks to an individual employee will affect their work-life balance. To go into detail, Every member of an organisation has some amount of work to do. Sometime, the efficient employee might have huge responsibilities in their shoulder just because they are doing all tasks very well. As a result of their efficiency, the manager keeps allocating plenty of tasks to them. This will affect their balance between workplace and family life. For instance, as per a survey of  the Times of India newspaper, most of the recognised employees are staying late in their workplace due the their heavy load of work.",
        "Another reason that potentially affect the equilibrium between work and family life of people is lack of planning. To go in detail, Most of the employes are unaware of the importance of planning while doing their job. They might have allocated to multiple tasks and most of the tasks might be repetative. Thus, the employee should figure out a way to do repetative tasks. By doing this, there work effort would be reduced and they can complete their work in a short span of time. For instance, most of the daily jobs in MNC's are automated by high efficient scripts. This will reduce the employee's effort to a great extend."
