        "It has been discovered that nowadays, the structure of families is different including roles played by family members. This is evident in the increase in gay families worldwide and the prevalence of single and divorced parents in many households. I believe the effects of this new trend could be problematic, impacting negatively on the lives of the children involved, reasons for my view would be discussed in this writeup.",
        "Firstly, there is a rise in the number of gay marriages who have adopted children with men as their mothers and women as fathers. With the legalisation of gay marriages, there has been an increase in lesbian and gay families. In such instances, children adopted into such homes either have two men as parents or two women. This development has more negative effects in the lives of such children. Statistics have shown that about ten percent of children in gya families tend to be more aggressive than their peers. A man is a man and can never replace a motherly figure and vice versa. Thus raising children in gay households makes such children grow up with a distorted view of what a home should be and they miss out of on the benefits that having two-gendered parents could offer.",
        "Secondly, more single parents and divorced families are seen in recent times. With advancement in knowledge in different parts of the world, rather than marry a man then raise children, some women would instead have sperm donors while men would opt for surrogate mothers to become single parents. Studies have shown that over twenty five percent of vagabond high schoolers have either a single or divorced parents. Being a single parent means only one person acts as both mother and father to the child, works to sustain the home and still has to be available to care for the child. This is a huge responsibility and in many instances one role suffers for the other, meaning that either the child lacks the financial support needed or lacks care from the parent. Furthermore, children from divorced homes were witnesses to a failed love relationship and this affects them psychologically, making them act out such frustrations often times in school either physically or in poor grades.",
        "In conclusion, family structure recently is not the same as in previous times having different roles like gay marriages, single or divorced parents. Children in such families should be monitored closely by social welfare and offered help if these untoward effects of being raised in such homes occurs."
