        "Statistical study has shown a steep rise in crime rate because of a number of reasons. This essay will dive into the causes and will suggest solutions to counter such problems in future.",
        "To embark upon, there are a plenty of causes of crime. The foremost being the poor economical conditions and disturbances are prevailing in most of the families, which motivate the people, especially the youth, to commit illegal activities in order to earn money. For instance, a study has shown that around 70% members of gangs come from families in which there are some tensions, thus, encouraging them to resort to unlawful activities. Moreover, due to glorification of crimes by media a larger portion of population gets influenced by it and commits wrongful acts. In addition to this, occurrences of many crimes can be attributed to racism and many foreigners living in the country becomes a prey of these anti-social activities.",
        "However, this increase in crime rate can be curtailed through plenty of different actions by the government. Firstly, the governing bodies can create strict and exemplary precedence so as to curb this menace to a greater extent. Secondly, new and enhanced social welfare schemes can be introduced to uplift the condition of poor in the society. Thirdly, the government can come up with new teaching techniques so as to impart moral values in the youth which will, in turn, help to create a crime free and ideal society. Last but not the least, a restriction on the contents of crime oriented films may be imposed so that the people are not influenced to commit criminal acts by imitating actors in movies.",
        "To recapitulate, albeit it there are several factors contributing to increasing crime rate in society, these can be rectified by proper implementation of effective measures."
