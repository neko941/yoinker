        "Eating trends have changed radically over years due to the access of ordering junk food at their convenience . This situation has created alarming health issues in Australia and child obesity is one of them . Research results  have shown that two out of three youngs are over weight. It is believed by a myriad of people that educational institutes has the liability of keeping an eye on the eating habbits of their pupils as well as their physical activities. However, I disagree and think that parents are more accountable for this . This essay will elaborate the reasons supporting this view.",
        "The foremost reason in the favour of my argument is that children spend more time at home than schools . Parents can easily instruct them about the benefits of eating healthy and about the consequences of unhealthy food And They eat the meals prepared by their parents. It is not possible for the teacher to check and ask them not to eat . Secondly , the job of the school is to give education to their learners not to make them phsically fit.",
        "Another vital point to consider in this regard is that the parents have a lasting and exacerbating impact on live of their children.  The eating habbits of a child starts developing as soon as the weaning starts . Parents have all the time and choice to introduce foods that are full of nutritions. Same goes for workouts as parents can make their offspring used to it.  Schools should not meddle with the eating and exercising regimes of children as it will have negative psychological impacts on them .",
        "I can conclude it by saying , although teachers are excellent role model for their pupils but still it is not their responsibilty to keep a check on the eating activities and physical exercises . All they can do is encourge the children to be healthy and active.  Therefore, parents should pay extra attention to the choices their offspring make in diet and working out.\u007f"
