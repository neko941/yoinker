        "The given line graph and the bar chart illustrate the information about the long-term international migration in the UK, between 1999 to 2008.",

        "Looking first at the trend of immigration and emigration, the figure for immigration  climbed from around 450 thousand in 1999 to almost 600 thousand in 2008. As for the number of emigrants, a gradual increase can be seen from around 300 in 1999 to 400 in 2006; however, the figure fluctuates in the following years, falling to about 350 in 2007 and then rising again, climbing to 420 in 2007, eventually.",
        "Moving onto the net figure of migration, in the first five years, the net population of emigration remained relatively stable at 150 thousand. While both the figure for immigration and migration grew in the given years, the figure for net migration frequently fluctuated in the following five years, it surged to 250 in 2004 and dropped to 200 in 2006, then eventually, it ended up at 150 in 2008."
