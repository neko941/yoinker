        "A lot of students usually travel or work for one year before entering the higher institution. While this has several benefits and drawbacks,in my opinion the drawbacks far exceed the merits.",
        "There are considerable benefits for the young school leavers to work before gaining admission into the university because this will enable them to gather funds for their university education as their parents may not be financially bouyant to sponsor them. Hence,this will solve part of the student's financial problem. Likewise, travelling before gaining admission create room for them to inquire about the course they are about to take in the higher institution. Moreover, it will increase their interest in such a course. For instance,a trip to the hospital may spur the students to study medical related courses.",
        "However,there are potential drawbacks for school leavers to travel before gaining admission into the university as it may take longer than a year thereby causing delay for the students. Similarly,they may be exposed to unlawful practices such as drugs, prostitution to mention but a few. Furthermore, unwanted pregnancies may occur in female school leavers. Again,the students may no longer be interested in attending higher school of learning when they decide to work and start earning.",
        "In conclusion,the drawbacks to students travelling or working before entering university seem to outweigh the benefits as the young school leavers may not be interested in attending higher institution and the may partake in illegal practices."
